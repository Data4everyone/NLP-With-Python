Prince Amleth, you have grown too old to be greeted as a child. Hail, Lord King. But… a father never grows too old for a good smothering! (LAUGHTER) How I’ve missed you, my son. Will your brother not grace us with his presence? Think not on Fjolnir. He’ll soon be with us. (SQUAWKS) This was worn round a prince’s neck when I found it. But it was destined for this prince. Wear it always with my love. Thank you, Father. My king. (DOGS BARKING) Fjolnir. MAN: (QUIETLY) Fjolnir’s back. (OTHERS WHISPERING) MAN: The brute has arrived. (WHISPERING QUIETS DOWN) Hail, Lord King. Furnish this fierce-hearted slayer of men with some drink, that I might drink to him. Accept my cup, kinsman. Milady. (HEIMIR LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Look how the queen’s cup grows wet for more men than her king. What metal might buy a fragrant sip? Sweet silver… Or hard iron? Silence, dog! By Freyr, you slander your lord and mistress! Please you, brother. (BABY CRYING) ‘Tis but a jest. A jest. Heimir keeps a foul tongue, yet I keep him as a deep-sworn friend.

To the Kingdom of Hrafnsey! ALL: Skoal! (WIND WHISTLING SOFTLY) (CLEARS THROAT) The enemy had a taste of my liver. Are you hurt? Almost enough for Amleth to be marked my successor. I watched his innocence tonight. He must be awoken to what awaits him. He is a puppy. He’s the same age as my grandfather when he took the throne. That was different. He had to kill his uncle first. You have not seen your queen in a season. Come. Let me take you to our bed. No. Pray my luck-spirits see me to many war fields after I defeat this wound. I refuse to die in sickness nor live the long life of a shameful graybeard. I must die by the sword. I will die in honor. (PAINED GRUNTING) Fret not. (WHISPERS) You will die in battle, my lord.

Wise in measure should each man be, yet wise enough to be the fool. Wise enough to be the fool. (DISTORTED ECHOING) Tell me, how did Odinn lose his eye? To learn the secret magic of women. Never seek the secrets of women, but heed them always. HEIMIR: It is women that know the mysteries of men. The Norns that spin and weave at their Well of Fate. Live in honor. Live in honor. Safeguard your familial blood. Safeguard your familial blood. Know you what that means, Amleth, son of Aurvandil? (PANTING) Should I fall by the enemy’s sword, you must avenge me or forever live in shame! I will, Father, I will! My blade will not rest till it’s drunk the blood from his open neck!

You were his queen. (GUDRUN SIGHS) Your father endured me because I bore him a son. No. His affections were only for silver and rutting his whores. I know not if he had heart enough to love you. (STAMMERS) Silence. He was a coward feigning to be a king. He was nothing. He was just another proud, lust-stained slaver. Hold your tongue! You spit in the face of your dead husband. (WHISPERS) Yet his brother… (GASPS) His fine brother. A bastard has no shame of himself nor his trade. Your uncle loved me, though he knew well my past. (SIGHS SOFTLY) (WHISPERS) Amleth. Even now, you believe the fairy tale I told you is true? “A noble bride hailing from the land of Brittany”? I never began as his bride. How easily we all become princesses again when the beasts take us for their wives. Yes. You were forced upon your mother. Gunnar was received freely with love. (WHISPERS) No. And know you this, it was I who begged on my knees for Fjolnir to kill King Aurvandil. I pressed my lips upon his strong, sweet hand. I kissed it and I begged.

Screaming? I was laughing. Lies! (PANTING) Now that you are here, what do we do? I should kill you and all that is dear to you. But you love me. A son loves his mother and a mother loves her son. And you saved your brother’s life. You. You love. You… love. None but me knows who you are. And you are so hot for revenge, child born of savagery. If you kill Fjolnir… (GASPING) If you kill Thorir, and if you are so untamed as to kill my Gunnar… (GASPS) You would be my new king, Amleth, and together we will rule.

(PANTING) I… I… I must take to the hills. My mother discovered who I am. Soon everyone will. I’ll go with you. No. They cannot know you are part of this. Come morning, they will hunt for me. Why? You killed her? I would not kill a woman. Not even her. Thorir met his end by my fury. Well, good riddance. Tomorrow night, you will return and kill Fjolnir? If the Norns of Fate allow it. And whatever happens tomorrow, be ready to run. (SOBBING) His heart. His… His heart. It’s taken his heart! What evil is this? What evil eats the hearts of brave young men? Freyr, do you hear me? Behave. Be a man in front of your inferiors. (SOBBING) There is no evil spirit here. I told you. I told you. It is my cursed son Amleth. We rid ourselves of him as a boy. You must believe me. He is here. The progeny of Aurvandil lives still. I fear he was led here by the raven-spirit of your dead brother. It’s not possible. Think. He’s killed your men. He has murdered your eldest son. And he will not rest till you lie cold in the ground and our own Gunnar lies slain beside you. It is Amleth. No god can help you with this task. You must discover my son and kill him with your own hands. Let my words be the whetstone to your biting rage, for the mischief of last night was not the work of one man. Find the slaves who ally with him. Find them! FINNR: On your knees! Down with you! (GRUNTS) Down with the lot of you! (GROANS, CHOKES) I know not, nor care not, if that slave aided in the death of my son… But this is the end you will all meet if you speak not what you know. (GRUNTS) No? (CHOKES) (GRUNTS, SHOUTS) (GROWLS) (GRUNTS) I see you’re no longer afraid of a woman’s blood. (WHISPERS) You. (LAUGHING) Of course it is you. AMLETH: Fjolnir! Let her alone! I offer you your son’s heart in exchange for her life! I am Amleth the Bear-Wolf, son of King Aurvandil War-Raven, and I am his vengeance! (YELLING) Kill him! FJOLNIR: Bring him to me! GUDRUN: Kill him! He’s mine! (MEN YELLING) (ALL GRUNTING) (PANTING WILDLY) (YELLING) (PANTING WILDLY) (GRUNTING) (AMLETH GROANING) (BLADE SLICES) In the end, you’re just like your father. Evil begets evil. How do you know it’s your son’s heart and not the heart of a rabid dog killed two nights ago? FJOLNIR: Where is it? (GURGLES) (GRUNTS, MUTTERS WEAKLY) You cannot kill me. Even if you were to strike me with your sword, it would not bite. It is not my time. I will die in battle. (FJOLNIR GRUNTS) Where is my son’s heart? (PANTING) Odinn the All-Father will vanquish your god of erections. Fear him. Silence! I will come back for your heart. And your mother and I will eat it. (STRAINS, YELLS) (RAVEN CHIRPING) (RAVENS CAWING) (ROPE CRACKLING) (GRUNTING) (RAVENS CAWING WILDLY) (GROANING SOFTLY) (PANTING) Odinn, let the Valkyrja, your warrior maiden, fly me to your shining gates. (CAWING ECHOES, FADES) I see my father and mother. I see my dead kindred. I see my master in Freyja’s hall. He calls me to him.

I did not carry you that far. I am no Valkyrja. The dreams of your afterlife must wait. Besides… I’m not done with you yet. My fate brought me to Iceland to carry out my pledge of vengeance. But my fate did not ready me for finding you. I thought I must always shield my heart in stone. I could not think I would open it to a Northman. You sacrificed yourself that I could flee. And you came back for me. I have never felt close to another person. Not since I was a child. I curse your mother’s evil. She murdered my past. Could it not be that your Norns of Fate have spun another thread for you to follow? What do your earth gods tell you? That wherever I go, I must take you with me. I have kinsmen in Orkney. We could find… We could find safe passage there. Together. Yet I cannot truly believe that you have extinguished your fire for vengeance. Hate is all I have ever known. But I wish I could be free of it. That is for you to choose. Let us find our future. (HORSE NEIGHS) Welcome, seafarers. The deck of this wooden saddle-beast will be the only ground you tread for 21 days. If our luck-spirits smile upon us. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) (IN ENGLISH) I was expecting more of Fjolnir’s men. His son was to join us. Thórir departed early (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) on his own ship. Anchor up! Sail down! Secure the shrouds. MAN: Shrouds secured. VOLODYMYR: Keep her downwind, helmsman. MAN: Aye, aye! Your wound. It is nothing to what we have endured. I have forgotten it already. (HEART BEATING SLOWLY) (HEART CONTINUES BEATING SLOWLY) My family’s blood. My own blood is inside you. You are the well our dynasty will spring from. I did not wish you to know until I could trust that our child would be safe. While Fjolnir lives, our children will never be safe. If he but knew of this, he would hunt you with all the fire of the gods. It cannot wait. Stop this. There is now a living thread that binds us. I was a fool. I wished to flee with you from my fate. My vision shows me you will have two. And my sword will save them. (GASPS) But you must come with us. You must! It was prophesied that I must choose between kindness for my kin and hate for my enemies. And see what hope we have before us. I choose both. Take her to Orkney. In return for this ring, my kinsmen will give you ninefold its worth. No! No! Amleth! (SOBBING) You will be mother to a king! We cannot escape our fate. No! (GRUNTS) Amleth! (SOBBING) Ride with me, daughters of the North wind! (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Carry me and mine to the shores of my children’s forebears. There I’ll grow you a forest of birch, fathomless branches to dance your tempest with, raptured by your most righteous breath!

Barry Lyndon is utterly the opposite of the loose, improvised movies which are so popular with many critics these days. Every detail of it is calculated; the film is as formal as a minuet. Filmed at the historic Fox Theatre in Detroit, MI in front of a live audience, Mike Epps showcases his comic versatility, charisma, endless supply of jokes and delivers non-stop laughter. Mike Epps tears up the stage at L.A.’s historic Orpheum Theatre in a special packed with blistering impressions and unapologetically raunchy swagger.'"

My heart is still racing. I felt it too. All thanks to your brute strength, Dash, and your knowledge of ancient Aramaic mathematics. Please. This has nothing to do with my two doctorates and my master’s in Gender Studies and everything to do with you, Dr. Love more. The truth is, I never thought I would find the Lost City of D. I would choose your words carefully. [Hissing] They will be your last. You led me right to King Kalaman’s tomb and his queen’s legendary Crown of Fire. And now I will be very rich, and you will be very dead. Hold up. Are these… Are these your snakes? No, they were just here. There were just hundreds of snakes in this temple just waiting for us to show up? Who feeds them? You feed them? No, what do they eat? Why is that one not biting that guy? Why is that happening? Are they trained not to bite henchmen or something? [captor] Yeah, well… [Dr. Love more] I mean, the snake-to-temple ratio alone… This is ridiculous. Delete. I… I think my character can still work. Delete. Loretta, you still have a story to write. Delete. [voice mail] Hey, it’s me, Beth. I don’t want to pull the whole “I’m your publisher” card, but I am. And I’m really looking forward to seeing this last chapter. But no pressure. No, there actually is pressure. The exact amount of pressure that motivates you but doesn’t paralyze you. You got this. Thank you. [voice mail tone] [Beth] Me again. Okay, so everything is set for the book tour, but, uh, the only thing we need is a book to tour with. I can’t help but get the feeling that you’re not finishing because you don’t want to leave your house. Listen, I know these last five years have been hard after John’s passing, and it feels easier to live in your bathtub, drinking Chardonnay on ice. But, girl, there is a great big world waiting for you and a book tour that I can’t cancel, so just make it happen, all right? Love you, bye! [Dash] We have to keep going. Let’s see what’s on the other side of that door. But what if there isn’t anything? There’s only one way to find out. Then Love more realized the treasure she wanted was lost forever and her adventures were coming to an end. That doesn’t feel right. Yeah, but that’s it. That’s the end. Well, John, here I go. Dulcius ex as per is. [Beth] Okay, honey, it’s showtime. Are you sure about this? Because I have a wedgie in the back and in the front in this thing. I feel like a nerdy figure skater. Sexy. Stunner. I’m all about it. No, it’s not. It’s not. How do I move in this? Don’t touch it. I’m not touching it. I’m holding it out. Stop it. Will you stop? Get it out now ’cause you can’t do that onstage. And we’re done. And we’re done. Okay, good. Do I need to be wearing a glitter onesie? You only have to wear this for two hours. Do not mess this up, do you hear me? This is on loan. Everyone’s wearing sequins right now. [camera shutter clicking] Why is she taking my photo? This is Allison. She is our new social media manager. And she’s gonna be helping us target that younger demographic. Meaning women in their 30s who wish they were in their 20s. Hey, what’s up? Um, I took over your socials, so this morning you tweeted, “Where are my ladies at? Meet me at Ballroom G at 5:00 p.m. #ShawnMendes. #GaggingToMeetYouAll.” Okay, we are having fun. Let’s go. [elevator dings] We need to remind people that you are still alive. People know I’m alive. And to remind them why this used to be the best selling franchise. In Romance. Yes, which is the top revenue-generating literary category. Revenue-generating isn’t how I would describe our presales right now. Just think of this as a way that uses word of mouth. Oh, you want word of mouth? Here we go. How’s this? “The only thing more lost than the city is the author herself.” “Loveless.” “Passionless.” Uh, “Way past her prime.” And, oh, “This is fake history at its worst.” A book tour could change everything, okay? We have to remind the fans why they love you so much. Real history. I merely season it with a smidge more nudity. History had a ton of nudity. [narrator on PA] Deep exploration. Steamy wondering. Will Love more and Dash find Queen Taha’s priceless Crown of Fire? Join them on their search. So, listen, I wanted to talk to you about something. [whispers] There’s so many people. I know how much you hate doing these things, so I’ve invited Alan to do the Q and A with you today. What? And the rest of the book tour. Beth, I expressly asked not to do any more events with Dash… Alan, Alan! He’s gonna humiliate me. He’s not gonna humiliate you. Thank you. You’re very good at your job. Thank you so much. Thank you. Let me help you with that. He is… He’s a body wash commercial. He’s always glistening all over the place. There hasn’t been an event where his shirt didn’t come flying off. You wish. [Beth] Well, he’s already here, so put on your big-girl panties and let’s get out there. Remember, no grumpy face, big words or boring academic talk. [audience cheering] [laughs] Yes! Yes! Come on, RTP! Ha-ha! Yes, my Love more-heads! I am so excited to introduce to you the award-winning author, Loretta Sage! Beth, I can’t do this. I’m not ready. Are you kidding me? Listen, I’ve got your back. You got this. Go give the people what they want. It’s not me they want. Get out there now! [audience cheering, applauding] Hi. How are you? Nice to see you. Thank you. Yep. Mount it. [chair creaking] Mount it. Mount it. Okay. Find your center. And now, the moment you’ve all been waiting for. The sexiest…[audience member] All right! Most influential hero of a generation. That’s a bit strong. His 20th cover of an Angela Love more novel. Dash McMahon! [audience cheering] [“The Final Countdown” plays] [audience member] Oh, my God! Dash! [cheering intensifies] Take a bow. I already did mine. I did mine. Okay, come on. One more. I got you. [cheering] [applause] [chair creaking] Did you guys rehearse that? Oh, my God. I’m loving this chemistry between you two, and I got to say, I love this book. Oh, thank you, Ray. Thank… Spoiler alert. A really bold choice to not have them go into the tomb at the end. Talk about what went into this one. I mean, this one’s such a special book for me personally. I… I don’t know how to say how much it means to me that Loretta, word writer extraordinaire, has, you know, named the book after me. The Lost City of Dash. The Lost City of D. Um, but that’s not what the D stands for. It’s D for “dick,” right? No dick, no. It’s based on the name of an ancient tribe, Dapoca',\n",
              "  'gihou-dysphem-ica. And, um, it was too difficult for the European colonizers to pronounce, so, in true colonial fashion they abbreviated it. No one cares about this. That’s so interesting. Okay. How about we take some questions from the audience? [audience member] Right here, handsome! Yes. Dash, what’s your favorite romantic moment? [Audience] Ooh. What I would really like to know is what is Loretta’s favorite romantic moment? [host] Ooh, spicy. Oh, uh… Well, being a sapiosexual… [audience murmurs] Oh, is that when they do the snakes around the… No. That’s someone who finds, uh, intellect or intelligence, uh, very sexy, you know. Same. Really? Dash! Rip off your shirt! [audience cheers] No, no, no. We’re not gonna do that today. We’re here for Loretta’s book. [host] Do we have questions for Loretta? Uh, yes, studious-looking young lady? What would you like to ask me? Can you rip off Dash’s shirt? [cheering] No, no. We’re not gonna do this again. Sorry. [audience chanting] Rip it off! Rip it off! Rip it off! Rip it off! Rip it off! Of course. Of course, yes. Can do. Is this happening? You don’t have to do this. Oh, we have to. We have to give the people what they want. Yes, yes. We have to give the people what they want, yes. Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy. Because The Lost City of D is Dash’s final adventure. If there even is a next book, it will open with Love more receiving the tragic news of his untimely death. What? Shit. I’m sorry. My smart watch is stuck. Ow. Hold on. I know. Don’t pull it. It’s okay. Just be real still. No. That’s pulling it. You’re pulling it. You’re gonna rip my wig off. No, you can’t… [audience exclaims] Oh, my! Oh, my God. Is he okay? God, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. [audience member] You’re a bad person. Stick around for the costume contest at 6:00 p.m. “If there is another book”? I’m investing everything we’ve got into this tour, okay? I just don’t think I have another Dash and Love more adventure in me. How does Dash die? Was it the snakes? No. Okay, so I have something that I have to take care of. You guys have an interview in the next suite in ten minutes. So can you please do me a favor and be grown-ups and get yourselves there on your own? Okay. Thank you so much. Does he die from a staph infection? It is a staph infection. I knew it. I-I… All right. Look, I get it if you need a break or something, but you can’t just kill me, okay? Okay. I hate that I have to ask this, but you do know you’re not Dash, right? Dash is a character I made up. Dash? [camera shutter clicks] Thanks. Thank you. Loretta, it’s this way. No, I think it’s this way. Can’t you see that Dash means so much to people? Means so much to you. Not to me. Well, yeah, to me, but to other people too. What about Beth? You know what? Beth is gonna be fine. She’s gonna find plenty fresh, young writers full of great ideas. You can transition gracefully into the shirt-on phase of your modeling career, and I can be left alone. Everybody is happy. No, it’s this way. Beth says you don’t even leave the house anymore. I don’t feel like that’s very happy. You should be going out in the world, filling yourself up on new experiences. I’m already filled up. I’m full. I’m fully satiated. Why would you want to be stuck at home alone when you could see the world? You could be visiting ancient Greece. Okay. How could I visit ancient Greece? I get it. Because you’re afraid of flying. No. Because ancient Greece is in the past. Just like Dash. Okay. You want to know who else is stuck in the past? You are. You’re so afraid of life hurting you again that you’ve stopped living. You’re like a human mummy. I didn’t, um… Oh. Mummies are human. Stupid… Oh, crap. I’m so sorry. I-I will clean this up. I am not a litterer, I-I assure you that. Do you, um… Do you think you could, uh, call a car for me, please? Thank you. Thank you. Bring the car around. God, is that someone’s retainer? I’ve never said the right thing one time around her. I get nervous because she opens her mouth, and just an encyclopedia of beautifulness comes out, and I just never say… You know she’s trying to kill me? I just need those tomatoes. You’re right. No, you’re right. I should apologize. Thank you, man. I appreciate that very, very much. You’re welcome. Uh, Loretta Sage. Yeah. Uh… Hiya. Uh, I did not order an UberPool. Someone wants to meet you. We’ll have you right back. Um… Loretta! Loretta! Loretta? [Uber driver] Uh, Loretta? Did you say “Loretta”? Yeah. Follow that SUV, man. No. Come on, please! No, no, no. I’m not helping any more handsome strangers. Fool me once. Mm-mmm. [bell dings] What is this, Taken? Am I “tooken”? Am I sold already? Am I… [blows air] Am I sold to him? [Loretta] Ow. Stop. Oh, no. Did this feel creepy? I said don’t make it creepy, guys. I’m so sorry about the setting. I just flew in. I was in a real panic to meet you. I didn’t have time to dress the place up much. I read you love cheese, so I just got them all. Are you the one who’s been emailing me for photos of my feet? No. Um… And I promise what I’m about to show you is gonna make you very happy. But first, a little bit about the mysterious rogue you see before you. Uh, my name is Abigail Fairfax. Abigail? It’s a gender-neutral name, like Leslie or Beverly. Yes, but you’re Abigail Fairfax of the media-mogul Fairfaxes? Didn’t you just take over your company or… No, that was my brother, actually. That was Leslie. We’re all very proud. Ah. Yes, I should say so, at such a young age to… Some might even say too young. But that world never really interested me. My passions, as you may know, lie in the hidden things in the world, things which defy possession. Um, some might call me a collector. But there is one obsession in particular that has held me captive. The Crown of Fire and its cascading red diamonds. Is this a… Is this a hidden-camera thing? So imagine my surprise when, in your new book, amidst the pages of coital reverie, was something… Oh, God… quite magnificent. [laughing] I get it. I get it. I so get it right now. Oh, my gosh. I literally thought you guys kidnapped me. I mean, this is marketing, right? Beth set this up? This was so good, you guys. This was amazing. You, with your gun and your mustache and your, “You’d better get in there” and you know… [laughs] Oh, my God. You, with the G.I. Joe tone-on-tone outfit. [Laughs] Your fictional archaeologist was making real translations of a dead language. Mm-hmm. Something nobody else has been able to do. Well, nobody else had ever tried. Is that right? Am I saying the right thing? Except you, right? Except me! Yes. See, it turns out Loretta Sage was once a young college girl doing her dissertation on the dead language of the D with her future husband, dreaming of finding Kalaman’s tomb and the Crown of Fire. I was sorry to read you gave up your searc',\n",
              "  'h after he died. But what that means is, you’re all I have left. All-All you have left for… what? Hmm. Oh. Here we go. [lid creaks] What is this? I believe it is describing the exact location of Kalaman’s tomb, in which Taha and her priceless headdress are buried. Well, if this were authentic, you would still have to uncover an entire city that nobody has been able to find. I found it. On a tiny, forgotten island in the Atlantic called Isla Hundida. What I have not been able to find is Kalaman’s final resting place. This piece of parchment is the only clue we found among the ruins. I need someone who can decipher these symbols. I need you. Well… Miss Sage, surely this isn’t how you want your story to end. We both had our dreams crushed by bad luck, or in my case, an arse-kissing little brother, but this is our chance to show them all. Come with me… to the island. Translate these symbols and help me find the Crown of Fire. You can name your price. I must respectfully decline. [lid creaks closed] Well… I can’t say I’m not disappointed. But I understand how you feel. Will you at least let us give you a ride? Oh, no, thank you. I’ll call for my own car, and I’ll just… [mechanical whirring] [aircraft blades whirring] [Beth] I don’t feel like you’re listening to me. This is urgent, and we… Okay, so the police are saying that they put out an APB… APB… on an SUV, and there’s this 24-hour rule… Why is there a rule? And they won’t do anything until… What about the FBI or the CIA? They said to call the police. I’m sure Loretta’s fine. When I was in college, my friend Nicki went missing. Everyone was, like, freaking out. But then she was just in her car. She was dead, but we found her. She wasn’t gone. Um, what about… Maybe we could get a PI or, like, you know, private security or… What about an extraction team, like the movie? Yes! But who does that? The ex-military, right? Oh, yeah. I think I actually have somebody that could help us. Oh. I did this meditation retreat, and there was this trainer guy there. You should see this guy meditate. But he’s ex-Navy SEAL. He… He’s a special ops trainer. What was his name? Yeah. Jack Trainer. So he’s a trainer named Jack Trainer? That’s how I have everybody in my phone. See, “Janice Mom.” “Larry Doorknob.” “Stacy Butt Stuff.” Look, this is what this guy does. He finds people. If there’s anybody that can help us, it’s him. [line ringing] [ringing continues] [on phone] Jack Trainer. Oh, so his name is actually Jack Trainer. Hi, uh, this is Alan from “Touching Your Inner Self.” The meditation retreat? [chewing sounds] Anyway, uh, okay. Our friend Loretta has been kidnapped, and no one’s helping us. [Jack] How long she been missing? Maybe two hours now. Who is that? Um, this is B… This is Beth. I’m Beth. And Allison is on too, sir. Did she have any Wi-Fi-enabled devices? She’s got her phone, right? No, I have her phone. Oh! She has a smart watch. It ripped my wig off. What was that scenario? Never mind. Open the phone. Go to the smart watch app. All right. Then hit “Find My Smart watch.” Oh, my… That is so good. That’s why we called. “Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy.” Is that Oprah or Deepak? Laozi from Tao-te Ching. Oh, my God. It’s in the Atlantic. She’s on a plane? [Alan] How can you tell that? ‘Cause she can’t swim that fast. [Jack] Doesn’t sound like a ransom scenario. My guess is blood sport, Hunger Games type situation. Possibly some coke-fueled dark web scavenger hunt. Real clown shit. We’ll have to move fast. How do we pay you? Cryptocurrency. Cash App. I’ll have her back within 48 hours or your next rescue is free. How many people need a next rescue? More than you’d think. I’m gonna need that phone. I’ll bring it to you. Let me know where she lands. I’ll meet you there, Alan. [aircraft jets whirring] Hello. Where am I? Um, you’re on my plane. It’s nice, isn’t it? Hmm? The seats are made of mama llama leather. Well, I’m getting off your plane. Unchain me! That’s your seat belt. Did you chloroform me? People actually do that? [grunts, groans] Well, you know, it’s a classic for a reason. My body feels drunk. It’ll wear off in a bit. I am sorry. I just couldn’t wait around for you to change your mind. Stop playing jelly. Time is not on our side. You see, the volcano we’re excavating around has developed a bad case of indigestion. I’m rather worried that when it blows, [grunts] everything that’s left of the Lost City will be destroyed. Oh, my God. My legs don’t work. So, this is our last chance to find both the tomb and the crown. Oh, God. [Groaning] [Fairfax] Oh! Don’t worry. That’s just our final descent. But it is the beginning of the greatest adventure of your life. [engine switches off, door opens] [door closes] [chattering in Spanish] Welcome to the Lost City. How did you find it? So, the city was built on a lava dome. As the volcano became active, the dome filled with lava, and sunken things rose to the surface. The D exposed itself. The entire city? No, no. Just the tip. As soon as I heard rumors of the ruins, I flew over and bought the place. The site? No. The island. The southern half. I got a good deal ’cause this is where the lava flows. We’ve been excavating for a year now. One doesn’t kidnap a romance novelist on day one. Ah, yes, as the saying goes. Rafi doesn’t like it. Do you, Rafi? He says we’re disrespecting his heritage. But not a lot of other job options on the island, are there, Rafi? Beggars can’t be choosers. No more charcuterie, I take it. Mmm. Please. I’m not a monster. Whatever you need, just shout. Uh, leave one hand free. She has some translating to do. And then what? Loretta, I really wish you would try and see what an exciting opportunity this is for us. I believe this text describes the exact location of the tomb. It’s a logographic system. Like cuneiform or hieroglyphics. Now, if you have other documents that possibly I can compare… Yeah, no luck there. We found some scratching at a nearby waterfall, but it was useless. Just pictures of women. Look, I, too, wish your dear old dead archaeologist husband was here to help, but he’s not, so, time to shine, Loretta, sex-book writer. They will come for me. Who, exactly? Your… Your many cats? Oh, I don’t have cats. Somehow even more sad. I have a hamster, asshole! You have a hamster’s asshole? No, there was a… there was a comma between… Forget it. I bet your brother never had to kidnap anyone!

              "  'like, I said some really mean stuff to her, and I regret it, and I just need to take it back. I called her a human mummy. Mummies are human. I’m aware of that now, yes. That is true. [breathes deeply] Please. All right, Alan, I can’t be responsible for you. Okay. Yeah. I need you to stay in the car. Yeah. In the car. In the car. The whole time. The whole time?

Hmm? Oh! Didn’t say. It doesn’t say. [Loretta stammers] Miss Sage, I need you to do better. Then next time maybe don’t kidnap a romance novelist, hmm? My God, this shouldn’t be this hard! It is not some pauper’s grave we’re looking for. It is a monument to a great man! King Kalaman was ambitious, he was powerful, he was the first man to build a city in the Atlantic. The eyes of his subjects would have turned to him. He would have had a pyramid, a ziggurat, a tower to hold his Crown of Fire. All I need to know is where it is. I don’t know if you recall, but you only said translate it. I-I translated it. Translate it again. One day, we’re gonna laugh about this. [Chuckles] Such an adventure we’re having.

[chuckles] You don’t need it. What is it? I just want her to think of me as more than a cover model. But, Alan, you are so much more. You’re my lookout. Okay, can I at least do the part where I put her in the car and I just go, “Shh. You’re safe now”? Sure, champ. She’ll love that. Oh, you’re just going? Going to start?

[Loretta shouts] [gunshot] [shouts] [Alan] Okay. What do we do? We need to do… I can’t see. I don’t like it! [Gags] Here. Here! Why would you throw a gun? Seriously? Get me out of the chair. I can’t.

Do you think you could get me out of here? Yeah. Okay. You just flew out of the car. I did. I did, indeed. Okay. I got you. I got you. Can you get me out of the chair? Get me out of the chair. You’re right. You’re right. You’re right. Is that… Is that a nail filer? Yeah. Can you just rip it? It’s working. And maybe next time I toss a gun at you, you can catch it instead of ducking. How about the next time you toss a gun at me, you say, “Hey, Alan, catch”? Then maybe do that before you throw it? Well, “here” is a synonym for “catch.” No, “here” is not a cinnamon for “catch.” In a colloquial kind of way, yes, it is. You say, “Here,” I toss you a sweatshirt. You say, “Here,” I toss you a pen. How ’bout just, “Hey! Catch! Gun!” Anything that you want to throw, I’ll catch it because you said, “Catch.” And I’ll catch it because you said it. That is also an option, and then we would have a gun with us. That’s a thing. Be careful. Okay, we need to call… Be careful. We need to call for help, get to the airport and get out of here. And I am driving. Okay. [both] Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Okay, call for… call for help. Where’s your phone? Okay. Tell me you caught them. I tagged the blond one. Oh, Loretta. What are you thinking? You might’ve killed one of them, but his partner’s still with her. And he is clearly skilled, highly trained and very dangerous. So, Miss Sage said she was gonna leave the event, then got in a car and left the event? Did you try calling her? She doesn’t have her phone. Stolen phone. Didn’t say that. [Nana] Where’s my magnifier? Listen, can you please help with Nana? I don’t want her hearing about Loretta ’cause it’s going to upset her. What about Loretta? Nothing, Nana. She just went on a trip. [Nana] Good. [Beth] Yeah. That girl needed to get out of the house. So, this is the thing. Loretta’s phone is not stolen. I took it. I gave it to Alan. Alan then gave it to the trainer, uh, Jack Trainer. And that is how we found her wearable. And who’s Alan? [Beth] Dash. What’s that? He’s the hero in all of her books. Nana. Hey, slut. Mm-mmm. Let’s go in the other room and talk about whichever war you lived through. Okay. Come on, it’ll be fun. I’m sorry. It’ll be fun. Listen, Loretta Sage is missing. When I looked at her smart watch, it said that she had flown to some island I’ve never even heard about. That means y’all need to do something about this. And if you can’t, I will, and that won’t look good for you. Pretty sure that’s outside our jurisdiction. You’d have to call the Feds. Okay. And if you do go to the Feds, put in a good word for me. For me. For us. Oh, oh. What are you gonna do, put the car back together? Well… we could… [steam hissing] Where did you say the phone was? Passenger glove. What? Passenger glove compartment. Goodness. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No phone, no car. We’re so gonna die out… Here. What is this? Boots for the jungle. It’s not exactly hiking boots, but… I figured your feet would be killing you after wearing heels for this long. It was the best we could do. They’re Allison’s. Sorry. Oh. Okay, well, thank you. Here, oh, I got you cheese. Oh, my God. You got to stay hydrated. Thank you so much. They didn’t have glass bottles, so we’ll definitely hold onto it and recycle. Okay, so what we need to do is find a phone, we need to call the authorities, and we need to wait here until somebody comes and rescues us. Uh… This… This is the rescue. No one else is coming. I’m sorry? I’m the rescue. It was originally just gonna be me, then I was like, Trainer should come. Oh, Trainer. Rest in peace. So, our best bet is to get to the airport. See this road right here? From this area, just take a shortcut through the jungle to the road. Did you just say “shortcut through the jungle”? Yeah. Okay, do you see us? Uh-huh. You are not Dash, and I’m not Love more. Okay? I’m Loretta, and you are Alan. And jungles eat people like us, okay? Eat people. And I don’t want to mess up the jumpsuit. It’s on loan. So we’re gonna stay put. We’re not just gonna stand around here, okay? We’re gonna go through the jungle, we’re gonna go to the airport and find a phone, so you can have your cake and get what you want. “And eat it too”? If that’s what you want to do with your cake, fine. Let’s go. That’s the only thing you do with cake. Not mine. [Loretta] I don’t know what your people do, but my people eat it. [Alan] You could give it to someone as a gift. [Loretta] Those people are still going to eat the cake. Everybody eats cake. [Alan] What about the kind people jump out of? They don’t eat it, when they’re in it. Oh, my God. [Alan] What did they kidnap you for anyhow? Is it some weird sex stuff like Taken? [Loretta] Oh, my God, thank you. I thought so too, but the guy’s one of the Fairfaxes. Beverly? No, the older one. The really odd one that had the vlog on finding Montezuma’s treasure. [Alan] The dude that was on the news for trying to raise the Titanic? [Loretta] Yes, he’s looking for the Crown of Fire. Wait a minute. Like the actual Crown of Fire? Like the one… So those ruins were… They were the Lost City of D, yes. What? Are you kidding me right now? Shh. This is like your book. So we’re basically on a Love more and Dash adventure right now? [insect buzzing] What is that? What if Fairfax actually finds the crown? He won’t. He won’t. [people shouting in distance] [Loretta] Where do we go? Uh… [vehicles approaching] Oh, oh, oh. Okay, uh, we need to get in the water. W-What? We need to go by river. No, no, I don’t really do water. What do you mean, “do water”? I’m not asking you to procreate with it. Uh, my body and water don’t really go together. [vehicles in distance] How do you feel about dying? Oh, God. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You’re okay. You’re okay. I got you. Fine. I can swim. I can swim. Thank you very much. Where are you going? I’m crossing. No, we have to stay in the water. I researched aquatic counter-tracking for my book, A Year in the Bush. They’ll lose our tracks in the water. Why is it warm here? Wait, are you peeing? Just go around it. [engines switch off] [Loretta] Okay, I think… I think we lost them, right? Yeah. That wasn’t so bad. Yeah. Okay, uh… Don’t panic. What do you mean, don’t panic? Just don’t panic. No. Stop saying “panic.” I’m panicking now. You have something on your back. [screams] No! Stop screaming. What is that? What is that? Stop screaming. Do you have any on you? No. No. Why don’t you have any on you? Maybe the jumpsuit scared them off. I don’t know. Get ’em off. Oh, my God. Okay. No, I can’t touch those blood-gorged mucous sacks. Can you fling it? Right now. Get it. Just pick it and fling it. Just pick it and fling it. You pick it and fling ',\n",
              "  'it! Can you spin it off? Please, get it off. I don’t like touching it. I’m feeling faint. They’re sucking my soul out. Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop. [groans] [gags] Don’t make that sound. [Gags] [gags] How many of them are there? Oh, there’s not many. It feels like there’s so many. What are you… I feel so many. Oh! Holy mother of God! Why are you praying? Is it that bad? It can’t be that bad. Is it that bad? How many? It’s not great. They’re gonna suck every bit of me out. Just please stop speaking. I just need to… need to get low. Hold on a second. [groans] Oh, God! I can feel them just… they’re just sucking out so much. I’m gonna be like a shriveled-up skin sack when they’re done. You cannot tell my dad I died this way, okay? You gotta tell him I was wrestling an anaconda with a sword or something. I’m like a blood Jamba Juice. They’re just sucking it all out. Why are they all on my butt though? Kind of like picking anchovies off my Caesar salad. It’s actually not so bad. Anchovies? Why do you go to food right now? Just find the queen, and let’s be done with this. Think you’re good. I need to just check your front. Okay. I can’t look. Is it bad? Uh, wow. What is it? Just say it. I mean, you expect it to, you know, not… Then suddenly there it is, and it is, uh… You know, you get excited for a person. What? I mean, I’m excited for all people. Why are you excited? Well, you know, people wonder, they wonder, but they don’t know, right? They don’t, until suddenly they do know, and then they… they know something that wasn’t known before. Just… Do I have any leeches or not? Oh, your plucky warrior hangs in tranquil solitude. What? No, you’re good. You’re good. We were so brave just then. Why do they go for the butt so much? [singing in Spanish] [insect buzzing] What’s that song you’re singing? A song my abbi used to sing to me when I was a kid. “If you suck life from the island… Yeah? The island will suck of you.” Your grandma sang you songs about getting sucked off by an island? It doesn’t translate super well. Is phantom leech syndrome, like, a thing? They don’t lay eggs, do they? Queen Taha? “King Kalaman and his treasure laid to rest…” laid to rest in the well of endless tears. “Laid to rest in the well of endless tears.” What does that mean? [Alan] Loretta! You gave me a heart attack. Where’d you go? What is this? I’m not sure, but maybe they gathered here? Can you imagine being right here, right in this very spot back then? The stories that they told? So much history I’m sure happened right here. [Loretta] They’ve got us cornered. Okay. We’ve got to go up. Come on. What? Have you seen what I’m wearing? I’m in a glitter straitjacket. There’s nowhere to go but up. Come on. Let’s go. [Loretta] Oh! I should not be doing this. I’m too old for this. No, you’re not. You’re beautiful. I didn’t say I’m not beautiful. I said I’m too old to be doing this. My skill is sitting and thinking and eating when I can’t think. Yeah, you definitely could be wearing better shoes for this. You brought me these shoes. I can’t go any further. I can’t go any further. I’m not doing so great here. You got it. Come on. I know you think that you’re safer holding on, but you have to keep going. I can’t. I can’t, I can’t. Okay? Do you smell that? Smell what? I smell something. Is it a predator? What is it? A downward cascading fire? You got to smell deeper. I don’t smell anything! [both breathing deeply] Take a big, deep breath. [breathing deeply] All right. Good job. Okay. That was manipulative. Thank you. Yeah, it was. Here we go. I’m gonna help you out a little bit, all right? One, two, three… Here we go! What are you doing? Get out of there. Come on. No, no, don’t flex. That’s my hoo-hoo. Just ride the head. Keep the hands moving and ride the head. Oh, God. You’re doing great. Sorry about the scratchy haircut. Come on. Dulcius ex as per is. What was that? Oh, nothing. It was just something that John and I would say after we finished something big, like a… like an archaeological dig or a manuscript. It’s Latin. It means “sweeter after difficulty.” What’s… What’s Latin for “Loretta’s a bad ass”? [laughs] I am a bad ass. I climbed a mountain. Oh, my God. I wish Beth could’ve seen us do this. Oh, God. Beth. Don’t worry about Beth. She’s probably got the whole navy after us right now. [Allison] I get that you think you have to go to the island authorities yourself, but don’t worry, I’m keeping Loretta’s socials super active. Just tweeted, “Did I just get kidnapped? #FML, @ShawnMendes, #ShawnMendes.” [ticket agent] And you’re traveling alone? Yes, I’m traveling alone. Mm-hmm. I’m single. Then this might work. Okay! Talk to me. You’ll hit New York. From there, you’ll fly to Guinea, where you can pick up a puddle jumper. A what? Small plane. [Allison] Yeah, no leg room. That’s fine. I’ll take it. Or you could just come home. Thank you. We need something more flammable. Everything is just so wet. What’s in here? What’s in your bag? Uh… Oh, a lot. Okay. What are you doing? Okay. Face masks. Yeah, that was like a gift-basket thing. You brought a scented candle into the jungle? My mom gave me that. It was like a weird gift for Mother’s Day. Your mom gives you gifts for Mother’s Day? Noir… Eucalyptus rosemary oil. Ooh. Oh, that smells good. Um… Oh, okay. All right. Whoo! Yes! Yes, I made fire! That’s pretty impressive. You have to… It is a beautiful fire. [Loretta] Who would have thought? Oh, you’re just, um, taking your shirt off? That looks really uncomfortable. Are you okay? The back? Yeah. That is why I don’t do water. Okay. My body becomes an eighth-grader’s face. Do you have anything for it? Like some ointment or something? Yeah, I do. Well, I did. It was in a little, tiny little bottle. It was this. I’m sorry. Oh, God, I’m sorry. It’s okay. Hold on. Yes. Come here. Come here. What? Come here. Sit down. Let me see. Just sit down. Right here? Yeah. Okay. Oh, no, you don’t have to touch it. It’s okay. It’s fine. I touched your engorged sacks, so… [snorts] [both laugh] The leeches. Oh, okay. Okay, this might be a little bit cold. Sorry. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Maybe this is how Dash should die. Horrible eczema outbreak. That’s so sexy. I could make it work. Yeah? All right, then. How would you write this? Okay. “Warmed by the fragrant fire…” Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] Starting strong. Mm-hmm. “Lovemore’s hands explored the…” The contoured scenery of Dash’s body. Familiar terrain made new and exciting with every… “with every scarlet rim.” And that didn’t, uh… didn’t turn her off? No. “Because with every cardinal ridge, Love more discovered another letter in the language “that only their bodies spoke.” And what were their bodies saying? “Take me…” Take me, “take me.” How’s that? It was good. Your back. I mean, how is your back? Good. Okay. You sure? Yeah. I also m',\n",
              "  'eant my back. Right there, yeah. Okay. Supplies. Okay, I’m chilly. I think I’m gonna probably turn in in a little bit. Okay. You good? Yeah, I’m fire… fine. I’m fine. I’m not “fire.” I’m fine by the fire. Okay. All right. Uh, it’s up to you, but if you’re cold, maybe we could probably both fit in here, if you wanted to. Both of us? Only if you want to. I mean, it’s just… Yeah, no, that sounds… Uh… Okay. How do you… You can go first, then I’ll figure it out. No, no, you go. It’s definitely a “ladies first” type of situation. Keep hands out of the bag at all times. That’s what I was gonna do. Butt to butt. Hands out and butt to butt. Yeah. What do I do? Just get in. Go ahead and sit. I sit first? Okay. I’m in. You’re too heavy. You’re gonna flip this thing like a cruise ship. [chuckling] You watch yourself. Hold on. I’m not in. Why is this engaging my core so much? [Laughs] [Loretta] How ’bout you shimmy? I can’t breathe. I’m not breathing. Are you good? My face. [Loretta] Yeah. Okay. [sighs, chuckles] [Alan] Hands are out. Butt to butt. [Loretta] Okay. [vehicle approaches] Well! Come on. Come on! Let’s hear it! Let’s give a nice round of applause to Loretta! She earned it. A geriatric shut-in left you holding your dicks in the jungle. Good job, Loretta. Boss, come on. People are dying now. Don’t you think that maybe this has all gone too far? Is it really worth it? I am on the cusp of attaining the unattainable. Something singular, something no nation, no emperor, no brown no sing brothers ever have. The legendary Crown of Fire. So, yes. Yes, I would definitely say it’s worth it. [motorcycles revving] Excuse me! Excuse me, sir. I need to get to my next connecting flight. No flight. The pilot is sick. Come tomorrow. No, no, sir. I cannot come tomorrow. I need to do this today. I need to get to the island Isla Hundida tonight. Lives are at stake. Come tomorrow. Excuse me, miss? Yes? I couldn’t help but overhear you say that you like steak. Okay, this is a little bit crazy, but I also like steak. What? I also like steak. Would you like to, maybe, I don’t know… Maybe there’s a… No. “Lives are at stake.” I need to go to the island tonight. Ah. Yes. Even more serious. Extremely. Well, I believe that I may be able to assist you. I have a cargo plane. Maybe after I make my delivery, we could swing by your island. I’m about to ask you something, and you better tell me the truth. Have you ever murdered anyone before? [laughs] No! I don’t know if I really buy it, but let me tell you something. If you ever think about murdering me, I promise, I will murder you first. My pleasure. You are weird. Let’s go. “King Kalaman and his treasure laid to rest in the well of endless tears.” [Alan] What is that? Oh, it’s a… it’s a thing. I mean, it’s not, uh… You know, it’s not what you think it is. So it’s not Fairfax’s fragment of an ancient parchment? Okay. It’s what you think it is. Loretta, I thought you were smarter than that. Fairfax is never gonna stop hunting us now. What were you thinking? We have a volcano that could bury the tomb before we get to it, before we see it, before we preserve its memory. This is… I’m sorry. Is that what we’re doing? ‘Cause no one told me. When were you gonna tell me? Why would I tell you? We’re in this together. I came here to rescue you. You know you’re not Dash, right? You don’t ride in on a white horse to rescue people. You… spray yourself with bronzer and you stand in front of wind machines, which is great for you. How would you have any idea what I’m actually like? I know you. You’re a pretty open book, Alan. Okay, then who am I? Really? Yeah. O… Okay, uh… You were a homecoming king and you coasted on your good looks to LA, but then realized that being the most handsome kid in the middle of nowhere doesn’t mean you’re going to be a star. Until one day, when a woman who couldn’t publish her book on Spanish colonization in the Atlantic decided to write a romance novel, uh, chose you at random to be on the cover. Lucky for you and her, the novels were a smashing success. She kept writing her schlock, you kept posing, um, you know, neither one of us becoming who we’d hoped we would be. Uh, and then one day, we both die in the jungle on one of those Atlantic islands I wrote about all those years ago. Right? Mm-hmm. It was Sarasota, by the way. It’s not nowhere. I grew up there with my mom and two sisters. And yeah… I started modeling ’cause I wanted to get away. It was the only job that I could think of that could take me to all of the places that I always dreamed of going. Then finally to Los Angeles, where I posed on the cover of your romance novel. And I was so embarrassed that one of my friends might’ve seen me in that wig on the cover of your book that I avoided talking to them for months. And then one day, I’m walking home, and I hear this lady yell, “Dash!” [laughing] She runs up, and she is so happy. Then I thought, “How could I be this embarrassed about something that makes people this happy?” Loretta, you can do whatever you want. If you don’t want to write anymore, don’t write. But don’t minimize the people that love your work by calling it schlock. That’s not fair to them. You know what’s ironic? I thought you of all people would know not to judge a book by its cover. Judge a book by its cover model. [faint rumble] [whispers] Alan? Alan. [vehicle approaches] [motorbike revs] [Loretta panting] There’s two of them. Loretta! I’m over here! Alan! Alan! Motorcycles and guns, motorcycles and guns! [gunfire] Come on, this way! [Alan] Stop shooting! Just give ’em the parchment! I can’t. Yes, you can, actually. You just say, “Here,” and throw it at ’em. Right. And then I’m sure they’ll happily let us go. Okay, keep down. How do they keep finding us? You’re basically a walking disco ball. We need to come up with a plan. I have an idea. We’re gonna dig a hole, throw our voices. “We’re over here.” Can you sound like a bird? No, I have a plan. Alan, please, I’m thinking. I know, but I have a plan. Please, just let me think about… Wait a minute. They’re shooting at you. Yeah, that’s why we’re hiding. No. No, no, no. They’re shooting only at you. They won’t shoot me. It’s my brain that’s valuable. What? I don’t think you actually hear the things you say sometimes. Maybe I can shield you. You are not shielding me. I should be shielding you. Why? Because I’m a woman? That’s supremely sexist. Well, look, I don’t think using women as human shields is exactly the change that Gloria Seinfeld had in mind, do you? Gloria Steinem? Whatever. Her too. You know what? Fine. Please mansplain sexism to me right now. Oh, my God. I am a woman. I can’t mansplain anything. Uh, I’m a feminist, and I think a woman can do anything a man can do. We just need to stay here until they get tired. I have an idea. Please can I tell you my plan? Alan! ',\n",
              "  'This is not a situation you can get out of by ripping your shirt off. Not my shirt. [Loretta] Three! Yes! Oh! [crashing] Oh. That was different than I had in my head. I just wanted us to stop them. Could it have been the wind that made it do that? No, I think it was us. I think… we did it. We did the one guy, right? But that was, like… We just wanted him to stop. But I think the other guy could’ve moved, really. So, that was… that one was on him. Even if we weren’t here, that could’ve happened. Why are you gonna stop next to a cliff? They were wearing helmets, so maybe they’re… But the rest of their body didn’t have a helmet. So there’d just be a head. They were driving recklessly, right? Don’t be mean on a bike. Don’t do mean stuff on a bike. I mean, perhaps they’re fine. Yeah, probably not. But that’s okay. That’s all right. You know, things happen. Let’s go. You gonna put it back together? It’s on loan. [squawking, bleating] Look at me. Okay. What more can I do, you know? You’ve done so much already, Beth. My poor, sweet, little Nana has lost her sight. The book release is a complete disaster, which I’ve leveraged everything on, so I’m probably, most definitely broke right now. And most importantly, I’ve lost a writer. Who does that? Who loses a writer? Okay, Beth, you remind me of my best friend, Randy. Always looking out for other people, never taking care of herself. Isn’t that right, Randy? [goat bleats] [chuckles] She’s like my therapist, this one over here. LOL. “Laughing Out Loud.” After you take care of your friend, how about we go to a beach? What? Look, I have a pickup in Hawaii. She doesn’t have to come. [bleats] Okay! Okay, you can come! [laughs] She’s hilarious. Let me ask you something. We’re all sitting here chitchatting, but who’s flying the plane? Autopilot. What? Sir, go to the cockpit, fly the plane. Okay. I’m going to go land the plane. Okay. No, no, no. Take the goat. Please, take the goat. She’s on break. Enjoy the flight! [bleats] [music playing on speakers] Hi. Hola. This English dude came in and basically kidnapped her. [line ringing] Hey, it’s Beth. Please leave a message, and I’ll get right back to you. [beeps] Uh, hi, Beth. It’s me. Uh, I’m alive! Uh, listen, um… Uh… I’m sorry that I blew up the book tour. Um… I was just afraid and selfish. Uh… Oh, here comes Alan. I’ll call you back. [puts down receiver] So, uh, police are searching for Fairfax, and they’re gonna provide us protection while we’re here. Did they say how long we’d be here? They’re gonna try to get us on a puddle jumper later this evening. But, uh, they said in the meantime, the inn is really nice, and we can get cleaned up and maybe a change of clothes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. [chattering] [laughing] Thank you. Come on. [Speaks Spanish] Dance with your husband. [Alan] No, no, no. He’s not my husband. It’s okay. [woman] Dance with him. No, no. She doesn’t want to. She doesn’t have the right shoes. Actually, it’s the only thing these shoes are right for. You don’t have to do this. It’s okay. It’s okay. Yeah? [boss a nova music plays] [music slows] [singing in Spanish] I wonder what she’s saying. [singing continues] It’s folklore. Love song about a woman whose lover died, and she didn’t want to leave his side. So she laid down and refused to get up. Must be scary. Having to face your future without the person that you planned it with. [singing in Spanish] What was that? Excuse me. Excuse me. The, um… the last line that you sang. ¿Quién llorará junto a mí? [speaks Spanish] [Loretta] “The island will weep for me in the well of endless tears.” What is that, the well of endless tears? Is that a real place, or… Sinkhole place. [speaks Spanish] Thank you. Gracias, gracias. Come here, come here. What is it? Hey, on the parchment, it said, “King Kalaman and his treasure laid to rest in the well of endless tears.” I thought maybe it was a metaphor. It’s not. The Well of Endless Tears is a place. It’s a sinkhole. There’s a sinkhole on the map. I think the tomb is there. This is so much better than your books. What? There’s like… No, I don’t mean any offense. I’m kidding. I’m kidding. It’s, like, equal. I’m kidding. I’m kidding. Look at you. You want to go there. What? No. I can see. Yes, you do. That would be insane. That would be insane. I just… I just… It’s just that we’re so close to it, but, you know, we can’t… No. This is your story. How do you want to write it? I’d like to know that it’s there, that all this meant something. Okay. Then let’s go. We’ll stay one more day. As soon as the sun’s up, we’re gonna go find the Well of Endless Tears. But what if it’s nothing? So what? Then we say we tried. And Fairfax? The cops are after Fairfax. Don’t worry about him. This is crazy. Yeah, but look at you. What? It’s the very first time I’ve ever seen you totally unafraid. And alive. I’m gonna go tell them our plans have changed and find us a ride. Where are you going? I see you met my friend here. He told me you were just about to jump on a plane, without so much as saying goodbye. I said, “No way. Not my Loretta. Not when she’s the only one who can lead me to the tomb.” [engine starts] [Loretta] Stop squeezing so hard. Ow. Get your hands off of me! Ow! Let go! I-I need a car. A car, an auto. Does anybody have an auto? No, no. No. I-I-I need an auto. I’ll trade you my watch. It’s a really expensive watch. Do you have a car? It’s a Bulgari. This thing glows in the dark. It’s waterproof. I have motorcycle. Cool, isn’t it? I always thought, why can’t your personal tank also have a minibar? Have a drink. [exhales heavily] Do you mind? [Fairfax] Uh, yes. He has a bit of a grudge against you, I’m afraid. Something about a motorbike accident his friends had? Why are you doing this? I want something nobody else has. When my father gifted… [horn honks] [horn honks] As I was saying, when my father gifted his empire to my baby brother… [horn honking] [vehicle accelerating] Who is that? Is that a Ken doll on a moped? I know him from somewhere. [Loretta] Oh, I-I-I doubt that. Because what you are looking at is a highly trained combat specialist, forged in the furnaces of Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Sa… Sarasota… Incredible skin. No eczema problems. And he will not stop until I am safe! So you pull this space tank over, unless you would like to perish like his friends did. And he is responsible for their perishment. He might not have meant to, but they… perished, so… Okay, who-who is this? I have seen him somewhere before. [thuds] [Fairfax laughs] No, no, no. That’s your cover model, isn’t it? Yes. I knew I knew him from somewhere. Get up there. And kill him creatively. I love watching hunks fail. [latch opens] [wind whistling] I guess I-I will have that drink. Oh, shit. Is it okay if I just top ‘er off? [Fairfax] Yeah, that’s fine, but… Oh, my God, have you used a glass b',\n",
              "  'efore? Sorry. [Chuckles] [Alan] What would Jack Trainer do? It’s hot in here. Anyone else feeling how hot it is? Are you trying to be sexy? This is very weird. Please, stop. I could set your world on fire. [men shouting] Go to sleep! Go to sleep! [grunting] Go to sleep! Sleep! [tires squealing] Whoa, whoa, whoa. [Alan] Time-out. Time-in! [grunts] No! Don’t shoot her! I need her! [tires squealing] [Alan] Oh, Jesus! Ow, ow, ow. Move your foot! Move your foot! [grunts] Go to sleep, asshole. Get out there! Look! A bigger guy? [Grunts] Oh, no. What? Move it! [tires screech] [Alan] No, no, no. No, no, no. Hey! Get in. Him or me? This is not one of your cheap, vapid lady-fantasy books, Loretta. This is real life. And we will kill him. Tell us where the tomb is. [grunts] [groans] Hi. So, whoever’s in charge, I need you to send officials to go here. Here. We are closed. You’re closed? You know I’ve been trying to take a nap for a year and a half? A year and a half. I have been burning the candle at both ends, the midnight oil, since way before my friend got kidnapped. And all I want to do is kick my feet back and drink some wine that I’m probably too tired to drink. And I want a massage. I want someone to massage my shoulders and my feet, and I want it at the same time. And I don’t care if logistically that doesn’t make sense. Because I have worked hard. The same way that I know that you have. So I hate to ask you to leave this place open a few more minutes, because if we don’t, a very close friend of mine and her cover model are going to die. [boat driver] No good way in, boss! What about the caves? That’s too dangerous! Well, we’ll be very careful then. Well, come on! This way. [Alan] I have a rule about not going into super creepy caves. [grunts] Julian? [Loretta] His name is Julian? [Alan] He seems more like a Buck or a Bruce. Lead the way. Go on. Don’t be scared. [rumbling] [explosion] [Loretta gasps] [laughs] [Julian] Watch your step there. [grunts, shouts] [Alan] Bruce! [Loretta] Julian. Oh, no! Julian! [gasps] Whoa. [shout fades] [Loretta] Whoa. [Fairfax] Well… Let’s not have his death be in vain. Onward and upward. What do you mean onward? We’re not gonna go and get him now, are we? [sighs] Oh, man. [Loretta] It’s nothing. [Alan] Okay. Yeah. Look, let’s just go back to the boat. This is over. Nobody else has to die. No, no, no. Ha-ha! It’s a breeze. There’s a tunnel. This could lead to the tomb. That’s not person-sized. Ah, speak for yourself. Come on. It’s practically a kiddie slide. More like a rock sphincter. Or a troll anus. All right, well, you are going through the anus… the hole… the tunnel! Why her? You are our canary in the coal mine. No, that’s impossible. I can’t. Please let us know if you get through. If we don’t hear from you, Fabio’s got to die. [Alan] Wait, I’m the damsel in distress? It’s okay. I’m fine. [wind whistling] [grunts] [panting] [hyperventilating] [grunts] [panting] [whimpers] I can’t. I’m so sorry. I can’t. Hey. What? Hey, you smell that? You mean centuries worth of bat feces? Yes, I definitely smell that. You gotta take a big breath for me. [inhales deeply, exhales] There you go. You can do it, Loretta. [grunts] I think I see a way out. [grunting, groans] Oh, cheese and rice! [grunting] I made it! I made it! [sighs] See? Totally safe. Go on. Your turn. [Alan] I’m coming through! Be right there, okay? [grunts] Why would they build this here? But how is anyone supposed to worship or remember you if they can’t even see it? [Loretta] They aren’t. This isn’t a monument to Kalaman’s power. It’s a hiding place for a grieving woman. Taha came here to be with her fallen lover. She just wanted to be alone. [rumbling] Taha doesn’t want us here. God, shut up, Rafi. It’s just the volcano. Come on. [Alan] We have to keep going. [Fairfax] All right. Let’s go, Muscles. Open it up. [rumbling] Don’t disturb them. She will be wearing the headdress. Come on. We didn’t come all this way just to pay our respects. I can’t, um… Uh… I’m sorry, abuela. [both grunting] [Alan grunts] What is that? [breathes heavily] Are those… seashells? The crown is made of seashells? Where’s the treasure? She’s holding him. You mean the dead guy? [Loretta] Look. It’s their courtship. Kalaman is searching the island for something. Rare red seashells. To prove his love, he gave her one shell every day for a year and made them into a crown, bright red like the flame of their love, until the day came where she accepted his proposal. It was never about jewels. Kalaman and Taha’s riches weren’t material. It was their love. That’s what it meant. That was enough. [Fairfax] So that’s it? All of that time and money spent on, what, just a cheap metaphor? It’s a pretty rich metaphor. Oh, shut up! [rumbling] We got to go. We got to go now. Come on. Let’s go. No, no, no. You are staying here. You think it’s all so sweet and poetic. Well, then you can stay here and spend your last moments pondering the richness of that metaphor. Get in. What? Come on, man. Oh, God. Just get in. Get in the tomb. Okay, okay. [Alan] It’s better to be buried alive than buried dead, I guess. [Loretta] It’s really not. You know, it is a shame, really. This is a hell of a story. Pity you won’t be around to tell it. Come on. But they’ll die. So will you if you don’t stop being such a snowflake! Get over here! [grunts] [Loretta] This is fine. This is not an active nightmare I’ve had since I was 14 years old. [Fairfax] Ow! [Grunts] Why are you going so fast? It’s not a race. [grunting] [boat engine starts] Wait, no! What are you doing? Come back here! You may have bought the island, but now the island owns you! You can’t just leave me here! Rafi! Come back! I need a boat! Hey, hey, stop! Stop! Help! Help! One of the locals just stole my boat! Have you seen a woman? She’s a brunette in a sequined jumpsuit. No. Is she in some sort of trouble? [Loretta breathing heavily] [both grunting] It’s kind of funny. I used to think this… this sort of thing was so romantic. Yeah? Being locked in a coffin about to be buried by lava, or… cuddling dead people? Just laying down with a lost love. Like Taha did. [volcano rumbling] God. Oh… Oh, God. I’m sorry. I’m sorry that I couldn’t save you. I’m sorry I couldn’t be Dash. You’re right. You’re nothing like Dash. You didn’t ride in on a white horse to save me. You rode in on a… borrowed scooter with a broken muffler. [chuckles] Yeah. I never could’ve written a Dash like you. ‘Cause I never knew a Dash like Alan. I was so afraid of being hurt by life again that I just stopped living. Couldn’t see the good things in front of me. I’m just so sorry I didn’t see you sooner. I have a confession too. See, I was really liking where this new story of ours was headed. I just wanted to see how it was gonna turn out, I guess. The Adventures of Loretta and Alan. No, it ',\n",
              "  'would need a better title than that. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Sorry. Just… Taha’s femur is poking me. [volcano rumbling] Rafi must have left that. [Alan] How do you forget your crowbar? It’s gonna help us escape. No, he left it on purpose. Oh, cool. I always liked him. One… Okay. Two, three! Okay. I would’ve preferred him to not leave us here in the first place, but… [Alan] Okay. [grunting] Dulcius ex as per is. Sweeter after difficulty. [rumbling] Go up! Run for the trees! Wait. Nope. Never mind. Trees are on fire. Okay. We can go back through the tunnel. Nope. Tunnel’s a no-go. [Alan] Um, okay. I’m open to other ideas. There’s a current. We can follow it into the ocean. How do we know what’s on the other side? We don’t. There’s only one way to find out. Worth the rash. Yeah? Alan? Alan! [gasping] Alan? A… [coughs] Alan? Alan! Oh, my God! You’re alive! I’m alive. Oh, my God. I thought I killed you. [laughs] Is that Beth? [Beth] Loretta! [Loretta] Beth! [Alan] Beth! [Loretta] Beth! Beth! Beth, you’re here! Why are you here? I told you I got your back, girl! I’m so sorry! I destroyed the jumpsuit! What? Never mind! Later. I found a British guy in a cave. I thought he was a little boy, but he has a full beard. Beth, that’s Fairfax! He kidnapped us! [Alan] He’s a bad guy, Beth! He killed my trainer! Get him! Stop him! [grunts] [grunts] I got your back, girl. Where were you running? It’s a boat. This guy’s hilarious. [laughs] Got you. [Beth] Swim over to the rock! I don’t got you. No, I got you. I got you. We’re gonna get you. It’s gonna be okay. [Allison] “Finding refuge on a nearby rock, he lifted her from the water, his powerful arms pulling her body close. Alan whispered…” Shh. You’re safe now. [Alan] “In that moment, Loretta could feel a new adventure was just beginning.” “The heart-pounding passion of the narrow escape only inflamed Loretta’s desire for him. She was thirsty for the hot lava soon to be pulsing from his…” Don’t you go stopping right at the good part. [chuckles] [laughs] It’s nothing she hasn’t read before. Didn’t I tell you? The most beautiful beach in the world. Maybe later, I’ll show you the Cove of Enchantment? No, you can take Randy. Remember, you are my platonic man friend. Platonic? I like the sound of that. Not sure what it means, but I like the sound of it. Here you go, Randy. [Grunts] My dear. You are an angel. Thank you. How did you know? Nice way to end a book tour, right? Mm-hmm. [sighs] Um… You know, I have a phrase I like to use in moments like these, actually. Um… Quid deinde? It’s Latin. It means, uh, “What’s next?” Quid cogitas? Mmm. Buca di Beppo. [both laughing] Yeah. I know zero other Latin. No. Yes. I looked it up for this moment right now. [sighs] So, what does come next? How would you write this? I don’t know. How would you write it? Do we really want me to write this? Just try. Take a stab at it. Okay. I’ll write it. Okay. “We were… They were, uh… standing on a beach.” Sets the stage for the audience. They know where we are. You’re already laughing. Why are you laughing at me? I’m not laughing. I’m smiling. You are. “There are palm trees above a brown bark-like hair of the maiden. There is a dead jellyfish…” All you’re doing is describing what you’re actually seeing right now. “He’s nervous because he really likes her.” It’s nice writing. Thanks. You’re welcome. I’ll keep going. “He looked deep in her eyes.” The only thing that could compare to the pulse of that ocean “was the throbbing in the…” Okay, no, you can’t throb. Why not? Can’t come out of the gate with a throb. You throb all the time. I don’t come out of the gate with it. You have to earn the throb. Who made you the queen of throb? It’s usually a chapter four thing. You want it brought up appropriately in four. I think you throb in all the chapters. “Pulsating.” It’s a precursor to throb. “Undulating.” You just jumped to five. How ’bout they just kiss? Why not? Just like a regular kiss? Yeah. Like a beginning-of-the-chapter kiss. I’m good at starting… How was that? Any notes?

Two decades later, Amleth is now a Viking who’s on a mission to save his mother, kill his uncle and avenge his father. * * * (THUNDER AND VOLCANIC RUMBLING) (RUMBLING CONTINUES) HE-WITCH: Hear me, Odinn, All-Father of the gods. (VOICES WHISPERING) Summon the shadows of ages past, when the thread spinning Norns ruled the fates of men. Hear of a prince’s vengeance quenched at the fiery Gates of Hel. A prince destined for Valholl. Hear me.

(WOMEN GRUNTING SOFTLY) (HORN PLAYING FANFARE) (RAVEN CAWS) CROWD: (IN UNISON) Hail, King Aurvandil War-Raven! Hail! (HORSE SNORTS AND WHINNIES) Like a battle-dog returning to its master, I’ve come to be fettered by my queen’s fair locks. Ever are we bound, my lord. Prince Amleth, you have grown too old to be greeted as a child. Hail, Lord King. But… a father never grows too old for a good smothering! (LAUGHTER) How I’ve missed you, my son. Will your brother not grace us with his presence? Think not on Fjolnir. He’ll soon be with us. (SQUAWKS) This was worn round a prince’s neck when I found it. But it was destined for this prince. Wear it always with my love. Thank you, Father. My king. (DOGS BARKING) Fjolnir. MAN: (QUIETLY) Fjolnir’s back. (OTHERS WHISPERING) MAN: The brute has arrived. (WHISPERING QUIETS DOWN) Hail, Lord King. Furnish this fierce-hearted slayer of men with some drink, that I might drink to him. Accept my cup, kinsman. Milady. (HEIMIR LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) Look how the queen’s cup grows wet for more men than her king. What metal might buy a fragrant sip? Sweet silver… Or hard iron? Silence, dog! By Freyr, you slander your lord and mistress! Please you, brother. (BABY CRYING) ‘Tis but a jest. A jest. Heimir keeps a foul tongue, yet I keep him as a deep-sworn friend. (CRYING CONTINUES) Come, brother. Here’s one more in need of your safekeeping than myself. FJOLNIR: (WHISPERS) Thorir. (SIGHS) Thorir! My son! To my brother, the War-Raven! To the Kingdom of Hrafnsey! ALL: Skoal! (WIND WHISTLING SOFTLY) (CLEARS THROAT) The enemy had a taste of my liver. Are you hurt? Almost enough for Amleth to be marked my successor. I watched his innocence tonight. He must be awoken to what awaits him. He is a puppy. He’s the same age as my grandfather when he took the throne. That was different. He had to kill his uncle first. You have not seen your queen in a season. Come. Let me take you to our bed. No. Pray my luck-spirits see me to many war fields after I defeat this wound. I refuse to die in sickness nor live the long life of a shameful graybeard. I must die by the sword. I will die in honor. (PAINED GRUNTING) Fret not. (WHISPERS) You will die in battle, my lord. The Gates of Valholl await you, I know it. (SIGHS) (RAVENS CAWING) (WIND WHISTLING) AURVANDIL: This is the same path I walked with my father and he with his. Now it is our path to walk.

(ECHOING) At every passage, one should turn his eye round, one should spy round. (ECHOING) For a foe might be crouched within upon the floor. Wise in measure should each man be, yet wise enough to be the fool. Wise enough to be the fool. (DISTORTED ECHOING) Tell me, how did Odinn lose his eye? To learn the secret magic of women. Never seek the secrets of women, but heed them always. HEIMIR: It is women that know the mysteries of men. The Norns that spin and weave at their Well of Fate. Live in honor. Live in honor. Safeguard your familial blood. Safeguard your familial blood. Know you what that means, Amleth, son of Aurvandil? (PANTING) Should I fall by the enemy’s sword, you must avenge me or forever live in shame! I will, Father, I will! My blade will not rest till it’s drunk the blood from his open neck! Now live always without fear, for your fate is set and you cannot scape it. Swear it. I swear. (AMLETH PANTING) (VOICES WHISPERING) (WHISPERING FADES) (AMLETH PANTING) (WHIMPERING SOFTLY) This is the last tear you will shed in weakness. It will be given back when most you need it.

But know that bearing a stolen ring makes no half-breed a king. Soaked in my blood, it will soon be sliding off your arm like a serpent. Your kingdom will not last.

Remember the Raven King. Remember. Remember, it contains the salty ocean you must sail upon to the edge of the world. It feeds the freezing river of hate that runs in my veins. It will take you to an island in the north where there will spring a burning lake, bursting from a black mountain’s peak. There I will drown my father’s killer. Follow the vixen’s tail to the dwelling of the ancient one to seek the fated sword that matches your brutal rage. Why speak you my fortune, witch?

So-called after he killed his brother, the disgraced King Aurvandil War-Raven. I know of him. Why are his slaves bound for Iceland? Fjolnir rules over Hrafnsey. He fled to the backwater frontier with his wife and son after King Haraldr of Norway took his kingdom. Fjolnir killed his brother for nothing. Now he’s a sheep farmer.

This ground harbors evil. My fate has brought me here. To find what was stolen from me. And what is that? A mother, a father, a kingdom. This is your kingdom? The traitor who stole my kingdom fled here when another king took it from him. I will leave when I’m done with him. I am Olga of the Birch Forest. And I, too, vow to escape this island.

And to stave off the latter, the least you can do is show your slaves you’re as strong as they are. But no one’s watching us. Go fetch us some whey. Think on what I said.

By name alone, you can tell he’s as strong as a bear. But if you’re as untrustworthy as a wolf, I swear I’ll put you down myself. We keep this one. The rest can go. But mother needs two for the kitchen and one for the laundry. MAN: Move. GUNNAR: And two males for the harvest. FJOLNIR: (SIGHS) Fine. These two for the kitchen and her for the laundry. And choose two males for the fields. And her, too. Keep her arms white… And her hair long. (CATTLE LOWING SOFTLY) Plan to climb out, huh, Bear-Wolf?

Tomorrow, I shall finish my deeds in honor. Only then will I discover whether living is to my liking. You are your mother’s son. And my father’s. I am come to avenge King Aurvandil, to choke my traitorous uncle in his death-blood and to free you. I see you have inherited your father’s simpleness. What say you? I never mourned him. You were his queen. (GUDRUN SIGHS) Your father endured me because I bore him a son. No. His affections were only for silver and rutting his whores. I know not if he had heart enough to love you. (STAMMERS) Silence. He was a coward feigning to be a king. He was nothing. He was just another proud, lust-stained slaver. Hold your tongue! You spit in the face of your dead husband.

How easily we all become princesses again when the beasts take us for their wives. Yes. You were forced upon your mother. Gunnar was received freely with love. (WHISPERS) No. And know you this, it was I who begged on my knees for Fjolnir to kill King Aurvandil. I pressed my lips upon his strong, sweet hand. I kissed it and I begged. And so this day would never come, Fjolnir ordered your death, along with your own mother’s blessing. (BREATHES DEEPLY) But I saw it. (BREATH TREMBLING) I saw Fjolnir carrying you away… Screaming.

And he will not rest till you lie cold in the ground and our own Gunnar lies slain beside you. It is Amleth. No god can help you with this task.

Yeah, only he wasn’t the first guy to do it. Magellan died in the Philippines on a random beach somewhere. It was his captain, Juan Sebastián Elcano, finished the trip with 17 others. Also known as the Infamous 18. I know the legend that his voyage wasn’t about exploration… it was about finding that gold… but it’s just a story. No. I beg to differ. These trips were hugely expensive back then. The king of Spain couldn’t afford it. There wasn’t gonna be any trip until a private financier stepped in. House of Moncada. SULLY: Yep. Bankrolled the Crusades, the Inquisition, Franco’s fascists in the ’30s and just about every horrible thing you can think of. They offered Magellan his grand voyage of exploration so long as he came back with that gold. How much gold? Today’s dollars… [EXHALES SHARPLY] Five billion, easy. It’s the biggest treasure that’s never been found. [CLOSES BOOK] Look, I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a kid, but somehow you already knew that.

That’s saying something, considering the company I keep. Look. NATE: Look at him. [CHUCKLING] He has a beard. Where is he? When was this taken? Almost two years ago, San Sebastián, Spain. We were getting close to Captain Elcano’s tomb, where Sam was sure we’d find his journal and in it the location of that gold. Then he disappears. Doesn’t call, doesn’t answer my texts, nothing. He ghosted me. Yeah, that sounds like my brother. Oh, so he hasn’t been in touch? Sam? No. Not even a postcard? No, not a postcard, phone call, text message, email, nothing. Hey, look, I don’t know what happened between you two, but I think if we find that gold, there’s a real good chance we find him, too. What do you say? Sam left when I was 10. He would call every once in a while, swore he’d come back, but he never did. The Sam that I knew disappeared a long time ago. So, nah, you’ll have to find somebody else. Wow. I’m really losing my touch. [SNIFFS] [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] SAM [VOICE-OVER]: Wish you were here, bro. [SIGHS] There’s a whole world you haven’t seen, but you will. I promise. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] [CELL PHONE RINGS] [CHUCKLES] Hey, kid. What took you so long? So, when do we start? There’s an auction coming up. Biggest collection of Spanish Renaissance art and artifacts anywhere this century. One of those items is La Cruz de la Hermandad. Only it’s not a cross. It’s a key… a key that unlocks the chamber where the Infamous 18 hid their gold. Very cool, but the legend said there are two keys, one for the captain and one for the crew, so no one man could steal the gold by himself. One key doesn’t do us any good. You ever get outside when you were a kid? I mean, how do you remember all this shit? [CHUCKLES] Only one thing: I already have the captain’s key. Second one’s in there. The Augustine… it’s an auction house. It’s very exclusive, but I got us on the list. Look, all I need you to do is kill the power during the auction. That’ll trigger the main alarm, and then I can do my thing. Okay. And how am I supposed to kill the power? Well, shit, that’s up to you. I mean, you got to bring something to the equation. I’m not cutting you in for fun. Actually, that’s a good point. We haven’t spoken about my cut yet. I assume we’re 50-50, right? Fifty-fif…? On what, the gold? Yeah. Are you high? You know this has been years of my life? You get ten percent, and that’s me being generous. Wow. That’s awfully generous. What are you gonna do with that kind of money?

You served, too, didn’t you? Dishonorable discharge. Hey, you did some homework, huh? Of course I did. I flew helicopters. I was preserving some artifacts from a museum in Baghdad. I was over the max load weight, crashed pretty hard. They got all upset, kicked me out. Bit of an overreaction, but what are you gonna do? You say “preserving,” but you mean looting, right? Well, if I didn’t take ’em, somebody else would’ve. You asked for that. Thank you. And what’s with the cat? Oh, the cat? She’s just for you. What? Yeah. Your life seemed super sad.

              "  'OWS] [♪♪♪] WOMAN: Hey, wait for me. SULLY: Hey. These people can tell a fake when they see one, all right? You have to believe the lie you’re selling. You belong here. You’re one of them. Or you can just go with the Bubblicious. Jesus. No, this is Bubble Yum. It’s the same thing. Here, put that in your ear. No way. Hello? Hello? I can hear you. I’m sitting right next to you. Oh, shit, I think I pushed it in too far. Is it okay? Let’s go. [♪♪♪] Oof. Look at that car. Bet that ain’t cheap. SULLY: Shit. Santiago Moncada. Like the House of Moncada? Yeah. He thinks the cross is his by birthright. If he buys it before we can grab it, you kiss that gold goodbye. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [LIGHT JAZZ PLAYING] BARTENDER: Welcome, sir. What can I get you? NATE: You know what, I’ll have a martini. Yes, sir. A martini? Yeah. Why not? That’ll go great with the bubble gum. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You should actually put the gum in the martini. You’d have a bubble gum martini. That’s actually not a bad idea. Yeah. My God, this girl is totally flirting with me. Where? There. The woman with Moncada. Look, she’s flirting with me. Hi. It’s not flirting, all right? Not with you. That is Jo Braddock. You ever see her coming, you need to run the other way. I’m serious. She’s coming this way now. Look. Yeah, then you know what to do. You’ll thank me later. Hello, Victor. Oh, what’s the matter? Feelings still hurt after San Sebastián? You’re something else. [CHUCKLES] So, what ridiculous scheme have you cooked up this time? Well, if I tell you, it’ll ruin the surprise. Well, you do tend to ruin everything, don’t you? I’m not the one working for Moncada. I mean, that’s low… even for you, Jo. Whatever gets me the gold, right? Well, you taught me that, Victor. Increíble. Whoa, Jesus. Oh, sorry. It’s pretty cool, huh? Well, it’s a one-of-a-kind solid-gold altar crucifix. Handcrafted in Barcelona in the early 16th century, so it’s… yes, yeah, it’s pretty cool, yeah. Wow. You know your crosses. My family has been looking for this one for a very long time. No way. So have I. Y-You are a collector? I dabble. I don’t dabble. This cross has a very tragic history. 18 men died trying to hold on to it. So much blood so needlessly spilled. [GAVEL TAPPING] AUCTIONEER: Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please. Good luck to you. AUCTIONEER: Would you please take your seats? The auction will be commencing very soon. [EXHALES] SULLY [OVER EARBUD]: Hey, Bubble Yum. You done chatting up our archnemesis? I’m pretty sure he just threatened to kill me. Don’t touch your ear like that. You look like an idiot. Get a move on. AUCTIONEER: Now, most of you may be well aware of the fact that… NATE: Gonna make my way upstairs. AUCTIONEER: …are made from some of the most exciting items, many of which are exceedingly rare, from our Spanish Renaissance collection. NATE [OVER EARBUD]: Uh, your girlfriend seems pissed. Is that something I should be worried about? SULLY: Just stay focused. AUCTIONEER: So, once again… Keep an eye on him for me. AUCTIONEER: …if you would, please come and take your seats. Thank you very much. [DOOR LOCK BEEPS] Excuse me. Okay, let’s get started, then, with lot number one. A magnificent oil on copper, “Our Lady of Good Counsel” by Bartolomé Pérez. [♪♪♪] Hello? 600,000, going once, going twice… Sold to the lady in the back. [APPLAUSE] Thank you very much. The cross is up next, kid. [TOOL WHIRRING] Um… Sully, don’t worry. I got it. [SIZZLES] Ow. [GROANS] AUCTIONEER: La Cruz de la Hermandad. Now, most of you will know this was made in Barcelona circa 16th century. It is truly a gorgeous piece and representative of Spanish Renaissance gold work. So, we’re gonna start off tonight’s bidding at 200,000. Do I have 200,000 in the room? Thank you very much. I have an opening bid of 200,000 from Mr. Moncada. NATE: Okay. Here we go. Do I hear four? How we doing? We’re doing great. AUCTIONEER: 500,000 it is. Do I have six? I have six. Thank you very much, madam. I don’t have all night. AUCTIONEER: Do I have seven? 700,000 from Mr. Moncada. Do we have eight? No takers? So, fair warning on 700,000. That is 700, going once… Don’t make me do this. …700, going twice. And… There we are at the back of the room. Thank you very much, sir. We have 800,000. 800,000 is the bid, ladies and gentlemen. Do I have nine? SULLY: I’m spending money I don’t have. Okay. Here goes nothing. Oh, God! Ya shouldnae come out to play with the big boys, wee’un, ’cause you’re about to get a proper Scottish welcome. I’m sorry? [GRUNTING] Mr. Moncada, it’s back to you now… 1.9. Mr. Moncada makes it an even $2 million, ladies and gentlemen. [CROWD MURMURING] Well, train’s already left the station, right? Why not? 2.1. Thank you very much, indeed. Mr. Moncada, over to you. Any advances on that? [WHISPERS] 2.2. We have 2.2, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, God, here she comes. I said ya shouldnae come out to play with the big boys, wee’un, ’cause you’re about to get a proper Scottish welcome! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I literally have no idea what you’re saying. You little… [GROANS] 2.2 is what we have. Do I have 2.3? He goes with it. Mr. Moncada takes it to $3 million. [GROANS] Stupid door. Okay. Um… Oh, God. Sully, I think you’re just gonna have to buy that cross. [GRUNTS, GROANS] AUCTIONEER: Fair warning. $3 million it is, going once… You better do something now. Kill the power, fake a heart attack… I don’t give a shit. [GRUNTING] AUCTIONEER: …going twice… And… NATE: Ah, this is gonna suck! [YELLS] [FRANTIC MURMURING] SCOTSMAN: Get back here! Get on him!

AUCTIONEER: Can we secure the cross, please? Thank you very much. SCOTSMAN: Grab him by the trousers and get him by the balls! AUCTIONEER: Security, can you go down and find out exactly what’s going on? You’re doing great. Hang in there. Oh… Oh, shit. [GRUNTING, WHIMPERING] [YELLS, GRUNTS] [GROANS] [CROWD GASPING] WOMAN: Oh, my God. Are you okay? [COUGHING] Hey, Trent, Addison wanted me to take that to the vault pronto. Okay. Thanks. GUARD: Everybody, remain calm. Sully, where you going? You can’t leave me. There’s only one rule in this game, kid: Don’t get caught. [PANTING] Excuse me, sir. We need to ask you a few questions. I think that’s a little rude. I think I should be asking you the questions, if I’m honest. Actually, you know what? I’m-a do you one better. I’m-a get my lawyer to ask the questions, starting with: Who installed that handrail? I mean, look at that thing. Hey! Hey, get back here! Hey! [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Even more ridiculous than I could have imagined. I don’t know. I think it was going pretty well so far. Funny. I think that belongs to me. Jo, come on. Save it, Victor. [DOOR OPENS] Save… Oh, thank God. Guys, she’s trying to steal the cross. Just put down the case and step aside. Yeah, put down my case. [CASE CLUNKS ON FLOOR] Step aside. I’ll get this to where it belongs. Good luck. GUARD: All right, lady. Stay calm, all right? [GRUNTING AND GROANING] [SIGHS] Sorry sons of bitches. [♪♪♪] [ENGINE STARTS] All right, let’s get out of here, Tony. Hey. You surprised to see me? Well, you proved yourself again, kid. That was some swan dive you took. You were just gonna leave me back there. Well, it wouldn’t do any good having us both locked up. Somebody had to get the cross. Holy shit, you got it. Hey, maybe I should hold on to that for… What, you don’t trust me? Oh, is that supposed to be funny? Here. Tony, take us to Teterboro. Unless you want to get dropped off somewhere else. Oh, yeah, you’d like that, wouldn’t you? Sorry, Sully, but I’m all in. Hey, Tony, Teterboro. [♪♪♪] NATE [CHUCKLING]: Wow. Captain’s journal. This is amazing. There’s some crazy shit in there, huh? It’s unbelievable. I mean, it totally confirms the legend. Magellan did find tons of gold in the Philippines. They hid the gold in Barcelona and then told the Moncadas that the trip was a bust. Okay, well, you have any bright ideas on how to use the keys? Yeah, here. The captain wrote, “The path begins in Barcelona where the keys turn into pine.” And then there’s a sketch here of a pine tree. Here. So we’re looking for a tree. Really? Yeah. Wow. That’s your expert analysis? Well, you just gave me the book like an hour ago. What am I supposed to do? I mean, I got that far on my own. I’ve seen the picture of the tree. Where’s the gold? Is it under the tree? Is it in the tree? I don’t know. Could be. Look out the window. There’s a lot of trees in Barcelona. [“COMO EL AGUA” BY CAMARÓN DE LA ISLA PLAYING] SULLY: All right, anything you need in Barcelona, Chloe Frazer can get it. I didn’t tell her about you yet, but she’s cool. Hey, Chlo. Who the hell is this? I’m Nate. I’m a friend of Sully’s. Sully doesn’t have any friends. I should know. I’m one of them. That’s not true. People love me. And what’s with the spy games? Why couldn’t we meet at the house? I was making sure you weren’t followed. Come on, you don’t think I can spot a tail? Mate, I’ve been on you since the airport. [CHUCKLES] Really? All the way from the airport? CHLOE: Look, it doesn’t matter. Why is he here? Why am I…? Why are you here? Clearly, you didn’t tell him. Chloe has the other cross. What? Did I not mention that? No, you didn’t. Are you sure? Well, look, it’s mine, basically, all right? Okay. So we’re all gonna be partners on this thing. That’s the way it’s happening, so get used to it. No, we’re not. Look, word to the unwise… everything out of this one’s mouth is an exaggeration, a half-truth or an outright lie. You know what? That is not true. See ya, Sully. That’s… Come on, Chlo. She’ll come back. She has to. I don’t think she’s coming back. So? Where’s the cross? It’s in my bag. Check your bag. Do it now. Shit. You let her take the cross? You let her take the cross. Shit. You better get that cross back! You got to be kidding me. What a rookie mistake. [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Could you move any slower?! I got a bad ankle, kid. I can’t be running around out here. [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Oh, shit! [GROANS] [BICYCLE BELL DINGS] NATE: Move! Out of the way! Move, move, move! [PEOPLE GASPING, MURMURING] Move! [GRUNTING] [FRANTIC CHATTER] [GRUNTING] [ENGINE STARTS] Listen! You don’t know where you’re going with them keys! Look, you’re looking for a tree, right? Piss off. [GRUNTS] Listen to me. The 18 were willing to wait years to go back for the gold. They wouldn’t have picked a tree as a marker. They would have picked something more permanent. You’re full of shit. SULLY: Hey. Let her go. She knows where to use the keys, then she doesn’t need us, right? Okay. Be my guest. Get out of here. Thank you. Bye. [SIGHS] If it’s not a tree, what is it? At the auction house, Moncada called it an “altar crucifix.” I didn’t think about it then, but it means that the cross was originally made to stand on an altar. In a church. CHLOE & SULLY: Which church? God, you guys never stop, do you? Look, if we want to get the gold, we’re gonna have to figure out a way to trust each other. So give me the key. Which church? [BELL TOLLING] NATE: Santa Maria del Pi. Saint Mary of the Pine. This has to be it. You might just be a genius. “G',\n",
              "  'enius” is a stretch. Oh, yeah? Look at that. Now you know why I brought him. Hmm. Okay. Good work. I’ll go see when we might have a private look inside. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don’t even think about it. What? Well, you don’t catch on too quick, do you? She’s not to be trusted. You met her for two minutes, she already stole the cross from you. She’s coming back. There’s a midnight mass tonight, so tomorrow’s the earliest we can poke around. SULLY: You got our gear at the house, right? CHLOE: Yeah. Come on. [♪♪♪] [IN SPANISH] Father. You said we were going to discuss this. [IN SPANISH] I changed my mind. I’m allowed. It’s not yours to give. You built none of it they did. Our fortune is dipped in blood. And giving it all away will release that stain? [CHUCKLES] I should have cut you off years ago. Ms. Braddock. Welcome to Barcelona as my ancestors knew it. Quite something, isn’t it? Yes, it’s truly an impressive excavation. Yeah. This competitor of yours, Victor Sullivan… maybe he’s the one I should have hired. Victor Sullivan is a liar and a fraud. Any deal you make with him is worthless. Perhaps. But I’ve been told, uh, he was seen in the Barrio Gótico. Maybe you should look into it. Yes, sir. Good. [QUIET CHATTER] CHLOE: I found my cross in a crypt in Genoa, but I didn’t know it was a key to a much bigger fortune. Sully knew. Doesn’t say what happens after we turn the keys. “Trust in your fellow man, for one will go to heaven and the other to hell.” Well, it’s ironic, seeing as the only point in having two keys was that the 18 didn’t trust each other. Well, good thing they didn’t, or we wouldn’t be here, right? Like one big happy family. Toast? All right. Arriba, abajo, al centro y pa’ dentro. Hey, kid, slow down. That’s a vintage rioja, all right? You might want to just taste it, savor it. Or chug it down like you’re on spring break. All good. I’m onto you, you know. Sully. What? He’s Sam’s brother, isn’t he? Oh, wow, you cracked the case. Great job. Does he know what happened? Not yet. I-I’m gonna tell him. When? Who’s still thirsty? I found another bottle of red. Hey, kid, you think she’s okay? Who? My cat. You have a cat? The man from the app said he was gonna feed her, but he didn’t text me back yet. I don’t know what’s cuter… your concern or the fact that you just said “the man from the app.” [SCOFFS] Stop. [SIGHS] [BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE] [SIGHS HEAVILY] [IN SPANISH] Do you come here to ruin the one place I find peace? [IN SPANISH] Father, you can’t give it away. Tell me it’s not too late. You can’t change my mind. I’m making the arrangements. This scavenger hunt is over. Padre. Do you really have no faith in me? In Him I have faith. [♪♪♪] Who the hell are you? Get out of my car! [DOOR LOCKS CLICK] Santiago, what are you doing? Forgive me, Father. [BLADE SLASHES] [ARMANDO GROANS] [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] NATE: Oh, great. Nuns. Why’s it always got to be nuns? All right, let’s just split up and figure out where the keys go, huh? [WHISPERS] Okay. [♪♪♪] SAM [VOICE-OVER]: Never thought I’d be back in church, but this one’s special. Hey, Sully. What? Nothing. Hey, guys. Come here. Look. CHLOE: “JSE.” Juan Sebastián Elcano. The 18 were here all right. NATE: Look, if that’s the cathedral, then these must be the stairs, and they lead… that way. [♪♪♪] Thoughts, altar boy? NATE: “Caelum.” That’s, um, Latin for “heaven.” Says in the journal, “Trust in your fellow man, for one shall go to heaven, the other to hell.” So, if heaven’s up there, then hell has to be around here somewhere. I hope. Hey, I got a skeleton with angel wings. That’s kind of between heaven and hell, right? [CLANKING] Does Mary look a little off to you? Yeah. No way. SULLY: Hey. Come on, open it up. I’m not gonna do that. We’re in a church, man. Come on, have some respect. Scared of a little old nun? Well, you haven’t met Sister B, have you? [CLANKING] Hold that. Here. Okay. [GRUNTS] Well, there’s hell. Whoa! Holy shit. You found ’em. Hey, what does that look like to you? CHLOE: A keyhole. Wait, which way should we turn, left or right? I don’t know. Uh, what does the book say? Um… oh, right here. Both-both of you, uh, turn your keys clockwise at the same time. Three, two, one. Turn. Shit! Thanks a lot. You almost got me killed. Clockwise, Sully? Well, it was 50-50, so I made a guess. A guess? That could’ve been our heads! Well, clearly, you should turn the keys the other way. Kid, I don’t even have my glasses. I can’t read this shit. Yeah, clearly. Just be careful, all right? You’re gonna get somebody killed. NATE: Okay, come on. Counterclockwise. Just look away from it. Ready? Here we go. Three, two, one. Turn. [RUMBLES] Whoa! Look at that. I was right the second time, huh? NATE: Like, an opening back here. [STRAINING] You want to help, Sully? Oh, kid, I’m watching our back. What if the nun comes down to get you? Chloe? [NATE & CHLOE STRAINING] SULLY: There you go. [GRUNTS] All right, we’re making some progress. Let’s go. CHLOE: No, wait. Hang on. What does the book say? Uh, heaven and hell. One of us goes up, the other goes down. Exactly. I’ll go down. NATE: Yeah, I’ll come with you. Really? NATE: What? Well, that was quick. What are you talking about? What, are you just gonna follow her down there like a puppy dog? What, you want me to come with you, hold your hand? You know what? It’s fine. Give me your cross. Not giving you my cross. Why would I do that? ‘Cause I’m probably gonna need it up there. You have your girlfriend’s cross, don’t you? You don’t need ’em both. Okay, good point. Well, give me your phone. No. Sully, just give me your phone. For what? What, you don’t trust me? I don’t trust anybody. I thought I told you tha',\n",

I say we go with God. But there’s literally an arrow that points this way. Suit yourself. But the arrow. I’m gonna go this way. Yeah, we should go your way. We should go your way. Um… Ah, great. Here we go again. Do you want to work your magic? So, uh, when did you decide to become Indiana Jones? When I was a kid, I liked to go exploring. [SIGHS] One day, I found a bronze statue covered in gems buried under a bridge. I’ll never forget the feeling, you know? I ran and showed it to my father. I thought he’d put it in a museum. But instead, he sold it. He kept all the money. We never saw him again. Wow, that sucks. I’m sorry. Why? I’m better for it. Here. I got just the tool. You see that? Sure, when the big bad nun’s not around. Does this look right to you? Well, I don’t really know what the path to ancient treasure’s supposed to look like. More ancient? I guess.

[INHALES DEEPLY] [GRUNTING] Chloe. [GRUNTING] Chloe, please. Come on! [GRUNTING] [GURGLES, COUGHS] [GRUNTS] Okay. It’s okay. [GASPING] Here, I’m gonna lift you out. Hey, guys. Say something. Tell me you’re alive. NATE: Yeah, we’re good. [SNIFFLES] We’re still alive. All right, then what are you waiting for? Get a move on. [CHUCKLES] Thank you. You had it. [SOFTLY] Yeah. Yeah. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [GRUNTS, PANTS] You good? Yeah. Hey, Sully, you still up there? SULLY: I’m here. What do you got? Not much. It’s dark as hell in here. I always wanted to try this. You need to give that thing up already. Oh, come on. Ha. See?',\n",
              "  ' That’s all I ask. Little faith. SULLY: I see a light. Is that you? NATE: Yeah, that’s us. We’re in some sort of… Roman antechamber. Whoa. [GRUNTS] NATE: Hey, you got that key? [BAG UNZIPS] Thank you. Okay. No, it doesn’t fit. Sully. Okay. Sully, we’re missing something. See if you can find anything up there. [GRUNTS] I can’t get the grate up. CHLOE: Forget the grate and look. I see something. Looks like a ladder or something. I think I get it. I think it’s the two keys put together. NATE: What? I said I think it’s the two keys put together. Throw your key down! Hey. You two think you’re gonna double-cross me? Hey, Sully, you want the stupid key, or you want the gold? Come on, this is it. Throw it down. I’m coming down there for this. You hear me? You ain’t gonna play me. Typical Sully. He’d rather lose the gold than… [CROSS CLANKS ON GROUND] Thank you. NATE: Does that look like a ladder to you? Yeah. [GRUNTS] Okay, ready? Three, two, one. [GRUNTS] [RAPID CLICKING, CREAKING] Did you see that? What are you waiting for? [GRUNTS] Whoa. What the…? SULLY: What’s happening? We found it. SULLY: Is the gold there? Talk to me. We’re in an old Roman storehouse. It’s got to be at least 2,000 years old, and there are these giant urns that are like eight feet tall. SULLY: Are they intact? Yeah, they’re perfectly preserved. So, what are you waiting for? Open them up and get the gold. Give me a lift. Here we go. Three, two, one. Go. [GRUNTING] Okay. Are you okay? [GRUNTING] Yeah, yeah. Okay. [YELLS IN PAIN] [GRUNTING] Okay. You good? Yeah. You see anything? [GRUNTS] [CRACKLING] NATE: Uh… Chloe? Salt. Chloe? I think we have a problem. Chloe? They used salt to store food, but… I don’t know why they’d put… [YELPS] [GRUNTS] [NATE GROANS] SULLY: What’s happening? CHLOE: No. It’s got to be here. Yeah, or why all the tricks? Answer me, guys. What do you got? The gold’s not here. [♪♪♪] Oh, my God. SULLY: What? What is it? They never brought it back. The path to the gold starts here in Barcelona, but it ends somewhere over here in the East Indies. Hey, Chloe. Give it to me. You’re kidding, right? I’m not getting screwed on this one. Pick up the map and give it to me. [SIGHS] Nate, what’s going on down there? Slowly. SULLY: Hey, tell me what’s happening. Sully, I got this. Look, you don’t have to do this, okay? Don’t… try anything. You can trust me. Just put the gun down. You have no idea who you’re partnered with, do you? You don’t even really know what went down. Went down with what? [SIGHS] Sam. Who do you think? What are you talking about? Ask Sully. No, no, no, no, no. No. Chloe, please tell me what happened to my brother. [WHISPERS] Please. You’re a good guy, Nate. [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] Too good. [♪♪♪] SULLY [ECHOING]: Hey, Nate. Wake up. Got you pretty good, huh? I tried to warn you about her, but you didn’t want to listen, did you? [GROANING SOFTLY] What happened to my brother? Stop thinking of the next lie you’re gonna tell me. [GRUNTS] Where’s Sam, Sully? I should’ve told you before. But your brother… he’s gone, kid. No, he’s not. You said he ghosted you. He’s gone. He didn’t ghost me. We went down to the captain’s tomb together to find the journal. And it was there, right where Sam said it would be. We were on our way out, and Braddock and her guys, they cut us off. They opened fire, and… and Sam got shot. So you just left him there to die. I saw a way out, so I took it. So you just left him there to die. What was I supposed to do, get shot, too? Nothing I could do. How could you not tell me this? Well, I knew if I told you, you never would’ve come with me. And why is that so important, huh? The hell am I doing here and not somebody else? Your brother believed that there was a final piece. All right? A last trick the 18 played. I thought maybe he said something to you or sent you something. I mean, shit, all he ever did was talk about you. So that’s what this is about. You dragged me all the way out here, let me believe that I might see my brother again because you think that I know something? Yeah. Do you? Did you really just ask me that? You said that money changes people… makes them greedy, makes them selfish… but you know what I think? I think that’s just who you are. I don’t think there was ever a better version of you. And whatever this is… now I’m done. Kid. [♪♪♪] BRADDOCK: Mr. Moncada. We’ve run into some difficulties. The gold was never here beneath the city. Yeah, I know. It’s quite embarrassing, huh? I believe there was a clue left down there, and we know who has it: a Miss Chloe Frazer. My people are out looking for her now… Oh, you mean the big guy who doesn’t talk and his sidekick, the Highlander? Yeah, they didn’t find me. Diversified investment. I hired Miss Frazer the same day I hired you. Of course, she will lead the operation from here on out. [BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE] SAM [VOICE-OVER]: I haven’t forgotten my promise. Remember, if something’s lost, it can be found. I know where she took the map. Moncada. Right? I mean, think about it. Who else is gonna have the resources she’s gonna need? And Braddock and her goon squad just so happened to find us at the church? He had to have somebody on the inside. You hate me. All right, I get it. Look, I’d hate me, too. But Braddock, after what she did to your brother? She shot him in cold blood. All right? We can’t let her win. She… Oh, Sully, will you please just stop trying to play me for like five minutes? For years, I told myself that Sam would come back. That he wasn’t gone, that he was just lost. But instead, I’m stuck here with you, so this is how this is gonna go. I’m gonna finish what my brother started, and then we go our separate ways. All right',\n",
              "  '. It’s a deal, kid. [CHATTER IN SPANISH] [SNIFFS] [WHISTLES] Hey. [SNAPS FINGERS] Be careful when you load her. I don’t want her getting scratched. Yes, sir. Nice car. Yeah. My father gave me this car when I turned 18. It’s been my good-luck charm ever since. The map. You know… it’s natural to feel some conflict. You made a difficult decision but the right one. I don’t really do regret. Neither do I. Shall we? When you’re right, you’re right, huh? You don’t have to apologize to me now. She only cut us out because she knew you were gonna cut her out. You’re still harboring feelings for that girl who knocked you on your ass, huh? Wow. MAN: Let’s go! Move it in, lock it down! All right, come on. They’re getting ready to go. MONCADA: Maravilloso. Now, who is ready to make a little history? I overlaid the map with modern satellite imagery. We’ll drop our supplies from the air, land in Kiamba, Philippines, where we’ll be met by our local forces. We should find the pot at the end of the rainbow here, in Cala de Oro. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Vámonos. [♪♪♪] [WHIRRING] PILOT [OVER SPEAKER]: Approaching drop zone. Lowering cargo door. To the victor… the spoils. Ah, come on. Give it to them. 500 years ago, my family was betrayed. Yes, a small band of explorers, they found the world biggest fortune. And you know what? They hid it. Uh, for centuries, people search for it, all in vain. It was left to me to recover my family’s gold. Nobody thought I could do it. And certainly not my… my father. Now, today… is the day I restore the Moncadas’ fortune. And I bring honor back to my house. And I earn my place in… [MONCADA GRUNTS] [GASPING] Daddy was right… you don’t have what it takes. The House of Moncada dies with you. Where’s Frazer? [SETS BOTTLE ON TABLE] No loose ends. [WIND WHISTLING] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTING] That was literally the worst ten hours of my life. You want to get caught, just keep talking. Oh, good job, Jo. Oh, shit. It’s hard to find a good partner in this game, huh? Well, maybe you’ll learn to appreciate me a little bit more. All right, let’s find some parachutes. Parachutes? What? Unless you know a better way to jump out of a plane. [SIGHS] [WIND WHISTLING] It looks like the lassie’s boosted. [QUIETLY] Hey. Don’t even think about it. I can’t just let her get away with it. This is not the place to pick a fight, okay? I’m trying to protect you. Put one of these on. Let’s go now. NATE: Hey! Did you kill my brother? I said, did you kill my brother, Sam Drake? Nate! Come on! [GRUNTS, PANTS] [MAN SCREAMING] Whoa. [GRUNTING] Whoa! Oh, God! [GRUNTS] [YELLS] [WIND WHISTLING] [BRADDOCK GASPS] Hey, Braddock! We found your loose end. [GROANS] Now get rid of her. [GRUNTING AND GROANING] [GROANS, SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] Oh, crap! [YELPS, SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [WHIMPERS] We can patch this up, Frazer. Drop the gun. [WHOOSHING] [EXHALES SHARPLY] [GRUNTING] I don’t think you’ve been counting. You’ve only got one shot left. I got to give it to you, Frazer. A fighter to the bitter end. This is a very bad idea. BRADDOCK: But this is the end. [GRUNTS] [YELLS] Whoa! [ENGINE STARTS, TIRES SQUEAL] [GRUNTS] Nate? Oh, come on! [GRUNTS, YELPS] [GRUNTING] What the hell are you doing?! You just hit me with a car! You don’t have a parachute? You don’t have a parachute! Follow me! What? [GASPS] Come on. [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Whoa! Oh, shit! [GRUNTING] [BOTH GRUNT] Pull the cord! Nate, come on! [STRAINS] I’m trying! [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING, PANTING] [CHLOE WHIMPERS] [NATE PANTING] Hold on. Hold on! [CHUCKLES] [BURBLING] CHLOE: I’m not gonna apologize, if that’s what you’re waiting for. NATE: I could probably forgive you for what you did in Barcelona. Maybe even for knocking me out of a plane with a car. But Braddock? Really? You really think there’s any difference between them and you? You and Sully were just as eager to screw me over as they were. Look, I’m not Sully, okay? Hallelujah. One’s bad enough. Nate? Do you see what I’m seeing? Well, if what you’re seeing is endless open ocean, then yeah. Holy shit. [♪♪♪] [CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY, LAUGHING] [CHUCKLES] Whoa. What the hell happened to you two? Fell out of a car that fell out of a plane. Huh. Hey, you know, something like that happened to me once. Ah. Okay. Good luck. And here is your card back, Mr. Sullivan. Please, call me Victor. Come on, I spent ten hours in a trunk with him. I couldn’t help myself. Let me show you to your room. Thank you. BRADDOCK: Moncada’s money has bought us everything we need. All right, let’s get to work. [♪♪♪] CHLOE: Hey there. NATE: Hey. What are you doing? Are you sure these dimensions are the same as the actual map? To the exact millimeter. Why? Braddock isn’t gonna find the gold. Well, not where she’s looking, anyway. You mean we still have a chance? The captain left one final clue, and Sully seems to think that Sam knew what that clue was, and he might have tried to tell me what it was. These postcards are the only thing I’ve got from Sam in the last ten years, so if he did try to tell me something, it… has to be in these cards. For the love of God, please be trying to tell me something, Sam. Is it something in the images? Or something in the writing. Like an anagram or a cipher. We used to do that all the time as kids. Well, let’s start with the images. Do blue. Colors. There’s a lot of blue. Okay, okay. Um… There’s one card where he spells everything wrong. Weird. Where is that? CHLOE: T-H-A-R… NATE: Um… Hills. H-Hills? Hills. So try writing, uh, this out. “Wish you were here, bro.” “Wish you were here…” NATE: And then for every letter you write down, find the corresponding letter. So, “Wish you were here, bro.” CHLOE: I’m gonna go to sleep. [SIGHS] Come on, Sam. W',\n",
              "  'hat are you trying to tell me? What are you trying to tell me, buddy? “There’s a whole world you haven’t seen, but you will.” “There’s a whole world you haven’t seen…” “Haven’t seen.” [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Okay, come on. Come on, come on. “There’s a whole world you haven’t seen, but you will. Promise. Sam.” [CHUCKLES] “The keys are your compass.” “The keys are your compass.” “The key…” Okay, okay, okay. Some compass, my ass. [GRUNTS] Holy shit. Blue goes there. And red goes there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Chloe. Okay. [♪♪♪] Get out. Okay. Jump. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Let’s go. [CHUCKLES] Not bad. Very good. [WAVES CRASHING IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪] [BIRDS SQUAWKING OUTSIDE] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] Chloe? CHLOE [VOICE-OVER]: I’m sorry, Nate. I like you. I really do. But I learned the hard way the minute you start to trust someone, you lose. Yeah, well… too bad you’re headed in the wrong direction. [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] BRADDOCK: What the hell? [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [GASPS, SPITS] [PANTING] [♪♪♪] SAM [VOICE-OVER]: Lost. Not gone. There’s a difference. If something’s lost, it can be found. We did it, Sam. [WHISPERS] We did it. [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [WOOD CREAKING] [SNIFFS] Cloves. You know, back then, spices were worth nearly as much as gold. Why am I not surprised? I keep too many apps open, remember? I knew you’d figure it out. Figure what out? The puzzle in Sam’s postcards. So, what is it? Does it matter? I already found the gold. I don’t see any gold. Oh, it’s here. It’s a false top. Old pirate trick. Here’s your gold you’ve been looking for. You happy now? Holy shit. You got to be kidding me. Well, look at that, huh? It’s almost more than we thought. Plus the other ship. Plus the value of the ships themselves, which you can’t even put a price on. We did it! We actually did it! Sully, we didn’t do anything. Okay? There is no “we.” There’s only you. Because there’s not a person in your life that you wouldn’t betray for a piece of this. You made that real clear. I thought that’s what we wanted. No, I wanted to do this with my brother Sam, not with you. I know. I’m sorry. But look around, kid. You did this. He’d be proud of you. [EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪] [MOTOR RUNNING] It’s Braddock. [WHISPERS] Shit. We’d better get small. Or, in your case, smaller. Hey. You’re only like one inch taller than me, max. I think it’s a little more than that, kid. Come with me. I know where to go. BRADDOCK: Magellan’s ships. Oh, they’re more beautiful than I could have ever imagined. Find the gold. If you see Sully, do not let him open that mouth of his. Kill him and Drake on sight. Aye. Be careful, gentlemen. These ships are worth a fortune on their own. You put a hole in my boats, I put a hole in you. [NATE GRUNTING] Oh, I’m not going in there. Hey, look. You could stay up here and get shot in the head or come down here for a quick cuddle… up to you. I’m going down. [SIGHS] Oh, God. [♪♪♪] [FOOTSTEPS ABOVE] SCOTSMAN: You see anything? MAN: All clear, sir. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] SCOTSMAN: Braddock. We cannae find them. They’re nae on board. They must have filled their pockets and fled. BRADDOCK: Keep an eye out anyway. Sully’s a cockroach when it comes to gold. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] PILOT: Wind is one-five-zero-one-five-nine. Hold TRQ at 4.2. All right, who’s clear? What is it with you and small spaces? [GRUNTING] Got this thing jamming up my ass. Wow. Don’t even think about it. Oh, I’m thinking about it. [BOTTLE POPS OPEN] Oh, my God. [GAGS, COUGHS] [RUMBLING] [SHIP CREAKING] All right, come on. Oh, Jesus. She’s flying the ships out? And us with them. What do you mean, she’s flying us out? [♪♪♪] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] BRADDOCK: Victoria, this is Trinidad. Are you ready to receive? Over. CAPTAIN: Roger that. Victoria standing by. Let’s bring her home. You ready up there, Scotty? Aye. PILOT: Hold TRQ at 4.2. COPILOT: Two degrees south. Geez, Sully, come on. The boat’s full of that stuff. Just in case. [GRUNTS] No. [GRUNTS] Hey. You want to go show ’em what’s what? That’s nice. Let me see it for a second. Yeah, nice, huh? Yeah, real nice. Hey. [GROANS] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] MAN: Holding steady. You ready for a mutiny? Why not? [GRUNTING] [YELLS] [GRUNTS] Whoa! [SCREAMING] Whoa! [GRUNTING] Oh, shit. [GASPS] That one’s a little more your size. Yeah, cute. [GRUNTING] [YELLS] [GRUNTS, GASPS] [SCREAMS] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not my gold! [MAN SCREAMS] [WIND WHISTLING] Oh, shit. Okay, you go to go hijack that helicopter. Right to the point, huh? All right. You know the drill, right? You don’t have to touch it with your finger to use it. Hey, Sully. Don’t crash. Just what I needed. Positive reinforcement. Thanks. [PANTING] Hey! All hands on deck! Raise the anchor! Hoist the mainsail! Hey, Jack Sparrow, stay sharp. Oh, come on, man, I’ve been waiting to do this my entire life. [♪♪♪] Hey, guys. [GRUNTING AND GROANING] MAN: Hey!
